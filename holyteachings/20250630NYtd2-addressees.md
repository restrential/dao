*The White Water Elder descends to a New York altar on the last day of June 2025 bearing the Mother's decree, and what unfolds over the next several hours is one of the longest and most personally attentive holy teachings in this collection. The Elder makes a complete circuit of the room — touching each person, each city, each temple community represented — and nowhere rushes. The effect is that of an elder who has traveled a great distance and will not leave until every face has been seen.*

## Opening Verse (鎮壇詩)

### 原文

　虛室生白吉祥來　認Φ歸根覺路開
　上善若水利萬物　淵沖涵洽霈澤海
　故舊見老愿還在　天意在人莫強猜
　修己渡人時不待　人一及之己可百

### Translation

From empty space, white light is born — auspiciousness arrives;
recognize the Mother, return to the root, the path of awakening opens.
Highest good is like water, which benefits the ten thousand things;
empty and inexhaustible, harmonious and yielding — its grace pours forth like the sea.

Old friends see this elder; the vow has not wavered.
Heaven's intention lives in humanity — do not force speculation.
Cultivate yourself and save others — time does not wait.
Where another needs one try, I shall try a hundred.

### Commentary

The teaching opens with an eight-line stabilizing verse that is dense with classical authority. The first line invokes Zhuangzi's "In the Human World" (人間世): 虛室生白 — "from an empty room, brightness is born." Zhuangzi's original context is advice to a minister about to undertake a dangerous mission: empty yourself of self-importance first, and the light of clarity will fill the space. The Elder begins here intentionally. The teaching that follows is long and demanding; its listeners need to be empty before they can receive it. The third line then quotes Laozi directly — *highest good is like water, which benefits the ten thousand things* — and the fourth line extends the metaphor into the inexhaustibility of the Dao: 淵沖 echoes Tao Te Ching chapter 4, where the Dao is described as an unfillable vessel, hollow yet perpetually useful. The Elder's opening verse is not decorative. It is a cosmological frame: the Dao is spacious, inexhaustible, and water-like in its beneficence. This is the standard against which all the human failures about to be named will be measured.

## Self-Introduction (吾乃)

### 原文

吾　白水老人　領　Φ敕令　降臨壇台　進門躬身　皇Φ叩拜　再為問候大眾等各皆安哉　平下心氣再訴衷懷　哈哈

### Translation

*I am the White Water Elder,*
*bearing the Mother's sacred decree —*
*I descend to this altar platform,*
*bow upon entering, kowtow before the Imperial Mother.*

*Then I greet all those gathered here: are you each at peace?*
*Settle your hearts — let me speak what is in mine. Ha ha!*

### Commentary

The self-introduction is characteristically humble. The Elder arrives bowing, kowtows to the Imperial Mother before addressing anyone else, and offers a warm greeting before any instruction. 平下心氣 — *settle your hearts and breath* — is less a command than an invitation: I have come to speak from my heart; let us meet each other there. The tone is set: this is not a scolding but a homecoming.

## Main Teaching — General Assembly (本訓)

### 原文

再臨人間表心情　弟妹得道何等幸
聞道不捨前賢引　共同把道展光明
道不遠人人自遠　能有幾個抱始終
道場人事之考驗　你非我是不能同
豈是道能人將毀　只因不明枉用功
若將假的做真看　戲台鑼鼓響𠾐咚
真道日常間應用　彼此和合禮敬通
如有不得反諸己　改過遷善立德功
不用單顯何人重　自行化道天命同
否則尸位而素餐　如何交旨面Φ容
六根清淨所視者　何有不宜耳順通
從來道能化實用　三業清淨抱合同
今既結緣面大眾　壇前點傳向前行
公修公得自明瞭　志向有否始終明
代天行化渡大眾　有其責任須辨清
不可自暴或自棄　輕視天命患無窮
人前顯貴後受罪　帶領大眾面無生
望皆後天返先天　念念緝熙樂無窮
尚有人事之歷煉　北辰居位眾星拱
禮理二字否切行　以身示範莫懵懂
如何人敬臨以莊　眾有苦難拔苦坑
如有不得求諸己　先聖後聖揆一同
居中定位迎大眾　先後有序倫弟兄
不論聰敏或被動　一同帶至彼岸登
　好嗎

### Translation

Coming once more among the living, I share what is in my heart:
how fortunate are those who have received Dao!
Hearing it without letting go, led by those who came before —
together we bring Dao's light to shine forth.

Dao is not far from people; people themselves grow distant from Dao.
How many are there who hold fast from beginning to end?
The human affairs of the temple are the trials —
"you are wrong, I am right" — this cannot stand.

Could Dao itself be destroyed by human hands?
No — only because one does not understand, effort goes to waste.
If one treats the false as if it were real,
the gongs and drums of theater rattle on in vain.

The true Dao is applied in daily life;
mutual harmony, ritual courtesy, and reverence permeate.
When things go wrong, turn and examine yourself —
correct faults, move toward goodness, build the merit of virtue.

No need to display who is most important;
walk Dao yourself — the Heavenly Mandate belongs to all.
Otherwise one holds a position like a corpse, eating without earning it —
how then to render an account before the Mother's face?

With six sense organs purified, all that one sees
has nothing unsuitable; the ears receive with ease.
Dao has always been able to transform into practical use —
three karmic actions purified, held together in harmony.

Now that we have met in karmic connection before all gathered,
transmitting masters at the altar's front lead the way forward.
Public cultivation, public attainment — understand this yourselves;
whether you have aspiration or not will be clear from start to end.

Acting in Heaven's name to transform and save the multitudes —
this responsibility must be discerned and kept clear.
Do not abandon yourself in despair or self-destruction;
to slight the Heavenly Mandate brings unending calamity.

Displaying prestige before others, then suffering for it after —
leading the masses, yet facing what is beyond death.
I hope all may return from acquired nature to primordial nature;
thought by thought, radiant and continuous — joy without end.

There are still the trials of human affairs to endure.
Be as the North Star — remaining in its place while all stars revolve around it.
The two words "rite" and "principle" — do you truly put them into practice?
Demonstrate through your own conduct; do not be confused.

How does one earn others' reverence? By approaching with dignity.
When the multitude suffers, pull them from the pit of suffering.
When things go wrong, seek the answer within yourself —
past sages and later sages: the measure is one and the same.

Stand centered in your position, welcoming all;
a proper order of senior and junior, brothers and sisters.
Whether bright and quick or slow to respond,
all must be brought together to ascend the other shore.

*Is this understood?*

### Commentary

The main teaching opens with the Elder's recurrent grief: how many who have received Dao actually hold to it? The 中庸 (Doctrine of the Mean) is audible beneath the line 道不遠人人自遠 — the Dao is not distant; people themselves withdraw from it. This inversion is precise and accusatory in the gentlest possible way. The Elder then names the chief obstacle: interpersonal friction within the temple itself. *"You are wrong, I am right"* — the line 你非我是 is recognizable to anyone who has worked in a community. The Dao does not destroy itself; practitioners destroy the community through ego. This is the teaching's central diagnosis.

The remedy is equally classical. Look inward — 反諸己 — when things go wrong. This is the Confucian practice of self-examination: before blaming the situation or the other person, examine what you yourself have done or failed to do. The line 改過遷善立德功 — *correct faults, move toward goodness, build the merit of virtue* — is a compressed summary of the moral cultivation project. And the Pole Star metaphor from Analects 2.1 then reframes the leadership task entirely: 北辰居位眾星拱. The noble cultivator does not push or manipulate; they become stable, and the community orients around that stability the way stars circle the North Star. This is governance by virtue, not by force of personality.

## Wen-Liang and Wen-Hui Family (文亮 / 文惠一家)

### 原文

請起勿跪換人言　當初開荒之因緣
藉由文亮來赴美　文惠一家居於前
時光匆匆數十過　倏忽容易遂百年
人生短暫活精彩　能在道場中奉獻
一點一滴累積厚　亦是有緣天恩沾
多少波折與苦難　才至今日滿腔歡
樂在道中無悔怨　常喜與人皆善緣
但有一點莫譏評　否則人厭離己遠
和合共辦獻苦忱　佛心老費計萬般
人心難化苦難渡　還得忍性與耐煩
吾之志願爾亦曉　老安少懷眾享安
可惜獨力是有限　還得眾志成城焉
即喜爾能提此程　大眾結緣同德壇
翻身來把道歌唱　重新立爐眾團圓
請起無有別囑咐　保重身心好邁前

### Translation

Rise — kneel no more. I speak of someone else now:
the conditions and causes of the original frontier-opening work —
through Wen-Liang coming to America,
the Wen-Hui family standing at the fore.

Time has flown; decades have passed.
In the blink of an eye, a century comes easily.
Life is brief — live it brilliantly;
to be able to serve in the temple is a gift.

Drop by drop, accumulating to depth —
this too is Heaven's grace touching those of karmic affinity.
How many twists and hardships,
to finally arrive at this day with hearts full of joy!

Find joy within Dao, with no regret or resentment;
always glad to form good karmic ties with all.
But one thing: do not mock or criticize —
otherwise people will grow weary and distance themselves from you.

Work together in harmony, offer your sincere toil;
the Buddha-heart and the elder have expended countless plans.
Human hearts are hard to transform; it is difficult to save them —
one must still practice patience and endure frustration.

My aspiration, you know it too:
the elderly at peace, the young cared for, all enjoying peace.
Yet one person's strength alone is limited —
we still need united will to build our wall.

I am glad you have organized this gathering;
all coming together in good connection at Tong De Temple.
Turn now and sing the song of Dao —
renew the altar fire; let all be reunited!

Rise — I have no other particular instructions.
Take care of body and heart; advance well.

### Commentary

The address to the Wen-Liang / Wen-Hui pioneer family carries a different register — warmer, more personal, almost nostalgic. The Elder reflects on the original frontier-opening work (開荒), the decades that have passed, the hardships that accumulated *drop by drop* into the thick substance of a life given to Dao. The note of caution — *do not mock or criticize, or people will grow weary and distance themselves from you* — is specific and practical. The Elder knows these people well enough to name their particular temptation. Then comes the aspiration the Elder cannot achieve alone: the elderly at peace, the young cared for, everyone enjoying peace. 老安少懷眾享安 — a phrase that distills Confucian social ethics into nine characters. The Elder closes this address with 眾志成城 — *united will builds the wall* — an idiom that appears several times in this teaching and functions as its structural refrain.

## Han-Zhong (翰中) and An-Kai (安凱)

### 原文

再來翰中吾亦喚　可捨愿表始終焉
人之百般要求等　皆以力能進獻前
如同中流之砥柱　中亦不出一怨言
還有安凱亦在壇　學習前賢表奉獻
乾道至今人較少　但能支撐來行健
有何需要幫辦處　皆能面前展笑顏
心寬示現道無限　未來前程皆可觀
今日壇前期爾等　共同把道來承擔
學習諸般聖凡兼　如同往聖與先賢
言此即請勿再跪　了然此生放優曇

### Translation

Next I also call Han-Zhong —
can you show what holding your vow from beginning to end truly means?
All manner of human demands and requests
you bring forward with all the strength you have.
Like a pillar standing firm in the middle of a current,
you stand there and utter not a single word of complaint.

And there is An-Kai, also present at the altar,
learning from those who came before, demonstrating devotion.
The male path — there have always been fewer practitioners;
but you can support and act with strength.
In whatever needs to be helped and handled,
you can always face others with a smile.
A generous heart reveals Dao's boundlessness —
the road ahead holds much promise.

Today before this altar, I expect of you:
together, carry and uphold Dao.
Learn what pertains to both the sacred and the ordinary —
as the ancient sages and those who came before have done.

With these words — kneel no more.
Understand this life, and offer your rare Udumbara bloom.

### Commentary

Han-Zhong is praised as a 中流砥柱 — a pillar standing firm in the middle of a current. The image comes from the Yanzi Chunqiu: a massive rock column in the Yellow River that held steady against the turbulent flow. To be such a pillar, the Elder implies, is not glamorous. It is to bear pressure without complaint. An-Kai is praised for his steady smile and broad heart, given the scarcity of male practitioners (乾道) in this community.

The address closes with one of the teaching's most arresting images. 了然此生放優曇: *understand this life, and offer your rare Udumbara bloom.* The Udumbara flower of Buddhist legend blooms only once every three thousand years — a symbol of the unrepeatable rarity of this moment. Each practitioner's lifetime is a flower of this kind. What will they do with it?

## De En Congregation (德恩眾人)

### 原文

德恩眾人且上來　閻昱瑞英與秋菊
秀鈺翰如與維楨　還有小小琳議前
道傳一代接一代　前賢哲人雖漸遠
自己也願發心愿　於是接棒頂坤乾
習禮有儀能渡眾　不論壇前壇後焉
配合道場之運作　縱然人數不多然
心甘情願是大愿　前賢費盡苦心焉
自己觀照尚否能　更進一步真道顯
有道可辦真榮幸　團結眾人返先天
　好嗎

### Translation

All of De En's congregation, step forward —
Yan-Yu, Rui-Ying, and Qiu-Ju,
Xiu-Yu, Han-Ru, and Wei-Zhen,
and the little ones, Lin and Yi, come forward.

Dao is passed from generation to generation;
though the elder sages grow ever more distant,
you yourselves are willing to give rise to the vow —
and so you take the baton and hold up heaven and earth.

Learning ritual and propriety, you can save the many —
whether at the front or back of the altar.
Working together with the temple's operations,
even when the numbers are few.
To be willing from the heart — this is the great vow;
the Elders have exhausted themselves with earnest care.
Ask yourselves: am I still able to reflect and see clearly?
Take one more step; let the true Dao be revealed.

To have Dao to carry out — what true good fortune!
Unite all people in the return to primordial nature.

*Is this understood?*

### Commentary

The Elder turns to the De En congregation — Yan-Yu, Rui-Ying, Qiu-Ju, Xiu-Yu, Han-Ru, Wei-Zhen, and the children Lin and Yi. The address is multigenerational in its gaze: Dao is passed from generation to generation (道傳一代接一代), the elder sages grow ever more distant, and now it falls to this group to take the baton and hold up heaven and earth (頂坤乾). Even with few members, the Elder says, a willing heart is a great vow (心甘情願是大愿). The address closes with 好嗎 — soft, rhetorical, intimate — the Elder checking in.

## Bill

### 原文

請起勿跪喚Bill　發心向道又重得
雖然考驗人事有　更保赤子心一顆
有心對天天知道　道的化身人喜有
上天不會辜負你　一家齊修真歡樂
真有孝心擔前後　自有助力天來佑
安心修辦人間世　立身行道蓮花坐

### Translation

Rise — kneel no more. I call to Bill:
you have set your heart toward Dao, and regained what matters.
Though the trials of human affairs are present,
keep safe that one child-like heart.

To have a sincere heart toward Heaven — Heaven knows.
To be an embodiment of Dao — people rejoice to have such a one.
Heaven will not let you down;
a whole family cultivating together — this is true joy.

Truly filial, taking on what comes before and after —
you will receive the supporting strength that comes from Heaven.
At peace of heart, carry out cultivation in this human world;
establish yourself and walk Dao — seated on the lotus.

### Commentary

The address to Bill is warm and concise. The child-like heart (赤子心) — the Daoist ideal of innocence and simplicity untouched by worldly calculation — is the quality the Elder most wants preserved through the trials of human affairs.

## Ya-Ping (亞平)

### 原文

請起勿跪誠恆首　再來喚那亞平說
有道同修真不錯　身在何處道開口
人在道中劫難躲　是非善惡逝水流
一顆心真行不惑　開口即能解人惑
引眾向道善導護　期能一同臻上流
世事不同前所知　稍有不慎即踏錯
於是君子三畏做　更能保合其太和
菩薩方便不思議　如來奧旨真功德
吾即不再多續語　請起勿跪一旁候
時雖有限欲續說　奈何人兒力不周
暫止一旁休片刻　再來握乩次壇說
　好嗎
　哈哈止

### Translation

Rise — kneel no more. With sincerity and constancy leading the way,
I turn next to Ya-Ping:
to have Dao and cultivate together — truly fine;
wherever you are, let Dao speak through your mouth.

Those within Dao can escape calamity;
right and wrong, good and evil pass like flowing water.
One heart, genuine in action, free from confusion —
open your mouth and you can already dispel others' confusion.

Guide the multitude toward Dao with good guidance and protection;
hoping all can together ascend to higher ground.
Affairs of the world have changed from what was known before —
a moment of carelessness and one steps wrong.

Therefore practice the noble person's three reverences;
this better enables the preservation and harmony of the Great Peace.
The bodhisattva's skillful means are inconceivable;
the Tathagata's profound purpose — this is true merit.

I shall not continue speaking further.
Rise — kneel no more; wait to one side.
Though time is limited, I wish to continue —
but this child's strength is not sufficient.
Pause here and rest a moment to one side;
then the planchette shall be held again at the next temple session.

*Is this understood?*
Ha ha — I stop here.

### Commentary

The address to Ya-Ping invokes the noble person's three reverences (君子三畏 — Analects 16.8): reverence for Heaven's decree, for great persons, for the sages' words. These three reverences, the Elder suggests, are the interior posture that enables the Great Peace (太和 — a term from the Book of Changes, 易傳, describing the supreme harmony that the Dao seeks to maintain). The bodhisattva's skillful means and the Tathagata's profound purpose appear together at the end of this address as a reminder that the tradition reaching back through Buddhism and Daoism has been pointing toward this very work all along.

The Elder's apparent withdrawal — *this child's strength is not sufficient; let me rest a moment to one side* — is touching. The phrasing 人兒 (this child) is the Elder's self-diminutive: an ancient being calling itself a child before the Mother. The humility is not false. In this tradition, even an Elder addressing hundreds of disciples remains a child before the Divine.

## Jue-De (覺德) and Meng-Long (孟龍)

### 原文

轉筆再喚覺德前　孟龍亦來聽幾言
年輕一代參與進　修辦行列驗真詮
道真理真天命真　顯現於人化坤乾
但是人有根器別　利鈍相差別天淵
有的改的容易點　有的反應不周全
咱要培養包容性　忍心耐煩去打點
理想欲要去實踐　不論在聖與在凡
誰人無有天明命　但是未必各現前
所以先覺覺後覺　亦有不知不覺員
牽引向善導其進　使人願意並喜歡
如此功德方圓滿　否則彼此置氣偏
從容中道火候煉　君子上達方應言
　是嗎
樂意配合上天辦　即是天使翅膀展
揹負何止僅一己　尚有萬眾待引還
努力精進道義研　出口成章皆成全
　好嗎

### Translation

Changing the brush — I call Jue-De forward;
Meng-Long also come and hear a few words.
The younger generation steps in to participate;
in the ranks of cultivation, the true meaning is tested.

Dao is true, principle is true, the Heavenly Mandate is true —
it manifests in people, transforming earth and heaven.
But people differ in their spiritual capacity;
sharp and dull — the difference is as vast as sky and abyss.

For some, change comes more easily;
for others, the response is incomplete.
We must cultivate tolerance and inclusion —
with patient heart and perseverance, attend to each.

Ideals must be put into practice —
whether in the sacred realm or the ordinary.
Who among people lacks Heaven's bright mandate?
Yet it does not necessarily manifest for each person.

Therefore those who first awaken help awaken those who have not yet awakened;
there are also those who remain unknowing and unaware.
Draw them toward goodness; guide their advancement —
make people willing, and glad to come.

Only then is merit truly complete and full;
otherwise each party is left with irritation and bias.
With composure, the middle way tempers you like fire —
only then does the noble person, ascending, speak what is fitting.

*Is this right?*

To willingly join in what Heaven arranges
is to spread the wings of an angel.
What you carry is not just one person —
there are still ten thousand souls waiting to be led home.
Diligently cultivate and study Dao and its righteousness —
when you open your mouth, it all becomes accomplished.

*Is this understood?*

### Commentary

After the pause, the Elder addresses the younger generation through Jue-De and Meng-Long. The teaching here is about the infinite variation in human capacity: some change easily, some resist; some awaken first, some come later. The Mencius passage (先覺覺後覺 — Mencius 5A.7) grounds the duty of those who have awakened: they must awaken others, not because it is easy but because that is the work Heaven has given. The note about tolerance and inclusion (包容性) is among the most practically important passages in the teaching. Without patience for the slow, the blunt, the not-yet-ready, no community can grow.

## North Carolina — Tian-Di, Hua-Fang, Xun-Zheng (北卡 — 天俤、華芳、訓政)

### 原文

請起勿跪下一樁　北卡誰來吾看看
天俤華芳與訓政　難得結緣共齋莊
其實身即示道場　不論行至哪一邦
如蘭幽谷無人賞　亦不阻其留芬芳
不怨天來不怨地　把握修辦每一場
道在自身非外覓　否則形同左道旁
既然內行見真道　即不同那外行詳
有的是真懂門道　有的是真熱鬧訪
咱修至道當明白　當仁不讓聖賢講
如真有心責任扛　前賢豈能置外講
　是嗎
既然不遠而來至　總要期許言略講
人心各個不一樣　真修道人真心講
抱道奉行非人看　自知之明得益彰
請起勿跪斷左旁　更去實踐真理想

### Translation

Rise — kneel no more; on to the next matter.
Who has come from North Carolina? Let me see —
Tian-Di, Hua-Fang, and Xun-Zheng:
how rare this karmic connection; together in purity and solemnity.

In truth, your own person is already a temple;
wherever you go, to whatever land —
like an orchid in a secluded valley with no one to admire it,
its fragrance remains unhindered.

Do not blame Heaven; do not blame Earth.
Seize every occasion of cultivation.
Dao is within you; do not seek it outside —
otherwise you end up beside the crooked path.

Since those on the inner road see the true Dao,
it is not the same as the outsider who only observes appearances.
Some truly understand the way in;
others are merely visiting for the festivity.

We who cultivate the ultimate Dao should understand clearly —
in righteousness, yield to no one, as the sages taught.
If you truly have the heart to shoulder responsibility,
could the Elders possibly set you aside and not speak?

*Is this right?*

Since you have come from afar,
I must speak some words of expectation.
Each person's heart is different;
a true cultivator speaks from the true heart.
Holding to Dao and practicing it is not for others to see —
self-knowing illumination yields the clearest benefit.
Rise — kneel no more; I conclude my address on this side —
go further into practicing the true ideal.

### Commentary

The North Carolina group receives a beautiful image: *like an orchid in a secluded valley with no one to admire it, its fragrance remains unhindered.* This is the classic image of virtue that does not depend on recognition — fragrance is not diminished by the absence of an audience. The Elder then states one of the teaching's core principles with compressed directness: 道在自身非外覓 — *Dao is within you; do not seek it outside.* External pilgrimage, external performance, external recognition — none of these is the source. The source is interior.

## Jun-Qiao Family (俊僑一家)

### 原文

再來俊僑一家子　聽吾幾言真心訴
屢經更迭境倏忽　變遷上下之起伏
方知人生大不易　幾個赤子心守護
咱是上天交任務　渡化蒼生的天使
不能因己私意覆　乃致耽誤了天時
若說力有所不足　問問是否老旁騖
移心外放羊怎牧　苦口婆心再引渡
重來又是一好漢　江山代有人才出
迎新革故貫終始　相信終能展鴻圖
　是嗎

### Translation

Next, the Jun-Qiao family —
hear a few words I speak from my true heart.
You have passed through repeated changes, circumstances shifting suddenly —
ups and downs, rising and falling through transformation.

Only then can one know: life is no easy matter;
how few there are who guard that child-like heart.
We are the ones Heaven has given a mission —
angels commissioned to transform and save all living beings.

We cannot let personal private intentions overturn it,
lest we delay Heaven's timing.
If you say your strength is insufficient,
ask yourself: is your heart straying elsewhere?

If your heart is drawn outward, how can you shepherd the flock?
Speak sincerely and tenderly again; ferry them across.
When you come back, you are a true hero again —
in each generation, talents emerge from the land.
Welcoming the new and reforming the old, from end to beginning —
believe that you will finally unfold the great plan.

*Is this right?*

## Rong-Hua (榮華)

### 原文

請起勿跪另言囑　榮華上來聽批宣
身亦老邁形佝僂　心志亦不減當年
有幸得逢明師遇　駕設慈船返先天
莫自謙而少言勸　主動積極代天宣
南極夀星七渾沌　未曾轉世翳先天
但仍持拐下壇來　苦口婆心費衷言
爾應亦可學其行　使人共肇太平年
　是嗎
此身不向今生渡　更待何時渡此身

### Translation

Rise — kneel no more; I have other words.
Rong-Hua, step forward and hear this proclamation:
your body has grown old, your form stooped —
but your will and aspiration are no less than in your prime.

How fortunate to have encountered a true teacher
who has set sail on the Vessel of Compassion to return all to primordial nature.
Do not be so modest as to hold back your words of encouragement —
act with initiative and vigor to proclaim Heaven's message.

The Star of Longevity from the South Pole, amid the seven primordial states,
has never been reborn into the obscurity of post-heaven existence,
yet still takes up a walking staff and descends to the altar,
speaking with sincere, tender effort from the heart.

You too should emulate this conduct —
helping people together to usher in years of great peace.

*Is this right?*

If this person does not guide others in this very life,
then when will this person be saved?

### Commentary

Rong-Hua receives perhaps the most moving individual address. The Elder acknowledges the stooped body, the aged form — and refuses to use it as an excuse. The Star of Longevity (南極夀星) is invoked as a model: a deity of such exalted standing that it has never needed to be reborn into the post-heaven world, yet descends to the altar anyway, walking staff in hand, to speak earnestly from the heart. The implicit message is clear: if a being of that stature makes the effort, what is Rong-Hua's excuse? And then comes the famous Buddhist urgency: *if this person does not guide others in this very life, then when will this person be saved?* The Monk Hanzhan's verse echoes here — the double meaning of 渡 (ferrying others across AND being ferried oneself) is intentional. Those who save others are themselves saved in the act of saving.

## Tong De Temple (同德壇)

### 原文

請起勿跪安身心　再來喚那同德壇
諸位道親共向前　富國國慶與宜艷
還有操辦打點者　辛苦百般不厭煩
咱修大道明言講　學著聖賢做一番
渡眾回天之聖業　豈能不明師心焉
諸眾身為弟子輩　師有愿力吾承肩
至死方休報恩典　莫作兒戲而輕觀
存心養性護真道　舉起慧炬放光鮮
照澈幽冥諸黑暗　切莫大道曲小見
人能得道代天化　豈非諸佛所共見
見證上天天命貴　於是身示道悠然
日常敬意敏於事　不宜道中嘻笑談
莊重自持即也溫　溫良恭儉讓路寬
心中有疑就去問　趁著前面有真賢
靜時精進道義學　不論老道新道焉
化成風氣皆好學　其出口皆是經典
如何如何爾自看　待等後進有真賢
請起勿跪不多講　能夠真行即真賢

### Translation

Rise — kneel no more; settle your bodies and hearts.
Next I call the Tong De Temple congregation —
all companions in Dao, advance together:
Fu-Guo, Guo-Qing, and Yi-Yan.

And all who have organized and handled the arrangements —
enduring every kind of hardship without complaint —
we who cultivate the great Dao must speak clearly:
learn from the sages and holy ones; put it into practice.

The sacred work of guiding all beings back to Heaven —
how can one fail to understand the Teacher's heart in this?
All of you, as disciples:
the Teacher's vow-power — I take it on my shoulders.

Until death I shall not cease, repaying the grace I have received —
do not treat it lightly, as if child's play.
Preserve your mind, nurture your nature, protect the true Dao;
raise the torch of wisdom and let it shine bright and vivid.

Illuminating all the darkness in the shadowy realm —
do not bend the great Dao to fit narrow views.
When people attain Dao and transform on Heaven's behalf,
is this not what all the Buddhas have witnessed and affirm?

Witnessing Heaven, the Heavenly Mandate is precious;
and so with your very person, demonstrate Dao at ease.
In daily life, be reverent and diligent in all matters;
do not engage in casual, laughing talk in the midst of Dao.

Composed and self-possessed, yet also warm —
gentle, good, respectful, frugal, deferential — the path is wide.
When you have a question in your heart, go and ask —
while the true sages and worthy ones are still before you.

In quiet times, advance diligently in the study of Dao and righteousness —
whether long in Dao or newly come to it.
Transform it into a culture where all love learning,
and every word that comes forth is scripture.

How? How? Look for yourselves.
Wait for the next generation to produce true worthy ones.
Rise — kneel no more; I will not say much more —
one who can truly put it into practice is a true worthy.

### Commentary

The long address to the Tong De Temple congregation is the teaching's most sustained exhortation on Dao as a way of life. The torch of wisdom (慧炬) must illuminate the shadowy realm; the great Dao must not be bent to fit narrow views; daily reverence and diligence are not optional additions but the substance of the path. The five virtues of 溫良恭儉讓 — gentle, good, respectful, frugal, deferential — are the Confucian formula for the person through whom the path is open and wide. The culture of learning (好學) that the Elder envisions — where every word that comes forth is scripture — is not utopian fantasy but a practical consequence of sustained, serious practice.

## Taiwan Visitors (台灣)

### 原文

台灣乘著飛機來　千里萬里誠虔在
有心能夠感天人　無誠難免空徘徊
秀梅開荒有心獻　寶臣亦然多助成
成全人須多方面　哪是一力簡單焉
成全右珊再開點　晨一林幸共助肩
何其有幸共同來　助了彌勒辦收圓
普渡須得寬心量　不可計較生侷限
雖是進道有新舊　但是修辦看己焉
能夠服膺而拳拳　行走十方人喜歡
莫看眼前之順遂　謹慎敬重道詳參
修道不是圖福報　功德自建過自刪
三省四勿諸聖演　還有親近眾成全
領了旨意來參辦　有日交旨面　顏
以何心性對眾勸　以何成就坐芳蓮
德者內蘊行外顯　願法諸聖渡人天
　好嗎

### Translation

Those who came from Taiwan by airplane —
across a thousand miles, ten thousand miles — your sincerity and reverence are present.
A sincere heart can move Heaven and humanity;
without sincerity, one inevitably wanders in vain.

Xiu-Mei, you opened new ground with wholehearted dedication;
Bao-Chen likewise contributed greatly to its success.
To help another grow whole, one must act on many fronts —
how could a single effort suffice?

Help You-Shan open another point;
Chen-Yi and Lin-Xing, shoulder the task together.
How fortunate that you came together —
helping Maitreya carry out the final gathering!

Universal deliverance requires a generous, expansive heart —
do not quibble and create limitations.
Though some entered Dao earlier and some later,
cultivation depends on yourself.

To yield with genuine devotion, earnestly —
walking through all directions, people will be glad.
Do not look only at present ease and smoothness;
be careful, respectful, and study Dao in detail.

Cultivation is not done in pursuit of blessings —
merit builds itself; faults erase themselves.
The three daily self-examinations and the four "do not's" — the sages have all demonstrated;
and then drawing near to help others become whole.

You have received the decree and come to take part —
one day you will present that account before the Mother's face.
With what quality of heart and character do you counsel others?
With what accomplishments will you sit upon the fragrant lotus?

Virtue: held within and expressed outward through conduct —
vowing to follow all the sages in saving both people and heaven.

*Is this understood?*

### Commentary

The address to the Taiwan visitors honors their journey and their sincere hearts. 有心能夠感天人 — *a sincere heart can move both Heaven and humanity*. The teaching then becomes specific: Xiu-Mei, Bao-Chen, You-Shan, Chen-Yi, Lin-Xing. Each name represents a story, a karmic strand in the larger weaving. The Elder identifies the gathering as part of Maitreya's final gathering (收圓) — the eschatological work of this White Era. The teaching's stakes are suddenly cosmic: these are not merely local temple activities but participation in the final act of Heaven's plan.

## Ai-Fang (愛芳)

### 原文

請起勿跪不多言　再來愛芳送幾言
有心回鄉去渡化　但怕人力未足發
懇請前賢多助力　自己誠心要穩紮
家庭齊了好渡化　不免苦心去覺察
眾人要的是什麼　恆順眾生猶如法
哪怕逆境之磨煉　亦是一心要上達
以和為貴行退讓　桃栽數年自果發
　是嗎
真誠能夠感人天　望諸一日繼步伐
請起勿跪不拖沓　言至此處欲止
可尚有何事牽掛　道予吾聞幫設法

### Translation

Rise — kneel no more; I will not speak much more.
Next I send a few words to Ai-Fang:
you have the heart to return home and guide others,
but fear that your human strength has not yet fully developed.

Earnestly request that the Elders give much assistance;
establish yourself with your own sincere heart, firmly grounded.
When the family is in harmony, you can guide others well —
there is no avoiding the earnest care required to perceive what lies beneath.

What is it that people truly want?
To ceaselessly accord with sentient beings, as is the dharma way.
Even if it is the tempering of adversity,
your heart is still set on ascending.
Prize harmony and practice yielding;
a peach tree planted and tended for years will naturally bear fruit.

*Is this right?*

True sincerity can move both humanity and Heaven —
I hope all of you one day will continue in these footsteps.
Rise — kneel no more; I will not dawdle.
I intend to stop here —
but is there anything still weighing on your mind?
Tell me; I will hear and help find a way.

## Administrator — Guidance Request (經理請示)

### 原文

（經理請示…）
打開心量容萬方　居中為貴人效法
使能治心與禮讓　不會糊塗辦一場
有否頂天之柱樑　能於爾後責任扛
遇難不會退縮也　遇善相助道相幫
行事謹慎有義方　莫徒熱鬧失端莊
每一佛子送到前　不捨不棄才應當
惜珍眼前人與事　莫只圖表做排場
　好嗎
時亦有限請起吧

### Translation

*(The administrator requests guidance...)*

Open your heart's capacity to hold ten thousand directions;
standing centered is the noble way — let people emulate this.
This enables one to govern the heart and practice propriety and deference,
so that one does not muddle through in confusion.

Is there someone who can be a pillar that holds up Heaven —
who can shoulder the responsibility going forward?
When facing difficulty, will not retreat;
when encountering goodness, helps and supports through Dao.

Act with care and in accordance with the right way —
do not merely seek bustle and excitement, losing composure.
Every Buddha-child, bring them forward —
to not abandon, not give up — this is what is called for.
Cherish and treasure the people and affairs before you;
do not just perform outwardly for show.

*Is this understood?*

Time is also limited — please rise.

### Commentary

The responses to the administrator's and transmitting master's questions are the teaching's most practical section. The Elder will not give a strategic plan; the Elder gives a principle, because the principle is what endures.

## Transmitting Master — Philadelphia (點傳師)

### 原文

（點傳師請示費城辦道往後應注意什麼…）
喚聲瑩仁上前來　成全Demond把心發
素萍母女亦聽話　人少不得辛苦啊
能夠撐持累不怕　那管風雨迎面刮
雖有諸般的經歷　仍能護持道心發
不論身在何境地　此種人才天人誇
但是謹言慎發話　以免招考法律打
通天大志人間立　誰能報恩行更佳
吾即幾句贈爾答　望莫嫌棄些勸話
請起勿跪不下述

### Translation

*(The transmitting master asks about what Philadelphia should watch for going forward...)*

I call Ying-Ren to step forward —
help Demond open his heart.
Su-Ping and her daughter, also heed these words —
with few people, the hardship is unavoidable.

To be able to sustain it — not afraid of weariness —
never mind the wind and rain blowing right at your face.
Though you have been through many kinds of experiences,
you can still protect and uphold the Dao-heart, letting it arise.

No matter what circumstances you are in,
this kind of person is praised by both Heaven and humanity.
Yet be careful and measured in speech,
so as not to invite scrutiny from the law.

Heavenly aspirations established in the human world —
who can repay this grace, acting with even greater excellence?
I offer these few words as my answer to you —
I hope you will not disdain this small counsel.

Rise — kneel no more; I will say no more on this.

### Commentary

The Philadelphia community is small and beset by challenges; the Elder acknowledges this without minimizing it. Ying-Ren is asked to help Demond; Su-Ping and her daughter are recognized for their hardship. The note of caution about legal exposure — *be careful in speech, so as not to invite scrutiny from the law* — is unusual in a holy teaching and reflects the Elder's awareness of the community's specific situation.

## Administrator — Tong Xin Temple (同心壇)

### 原文

（經理問同心壇有否機緣擴大…）
亦須眾志成城呀
突破難關人與事　使人有信願共駕
　是嗎
福自己求非天賜　善果栽下善緣發
勿使有漏而雜遝　抱其初衷持恆達
祝福善愿皆能成　滴水穿石沙成塔
　好嗎
須有三合土混合　結構力柱支撐廈
不可輕浮而狎慢　怠荒妄作則難達
團結眾志合一塊　知所為何成其大
心性心量能通達　不懼考驗與其他
佛壇宗旨道勸化　問問幾個道為家
願意身繫責任大　吃苦耐勞都不怕
　是吧
好好誠敬表奉獻　天不辜負開蓮花
請起勿跪牽手呀　以何指引眾回家
看這看那心牽掛　猶有不能真放下

### Translation

*(The administrator asks whether Tong Xin Temple has conditions for expansion...)*

That too requires united will to build the city wall —
break through the difficult barriers in human affairs and situations,
giving people confidence and the will to sail together.

*Is this right?*

Blessings are sought by oneself, not granted by Heaven;
plant good fruit — good karmic connections will arise.
Do not allow there to be leaks and disorder —
hold to the original aspiration; maintain it steadily and arrive.
I bless all good vows to be fulfilled —
dripping water pierces stone; grains of sand become a pagoda.

*Is this understood?*

What is needed is the mixing of mortar —
structural pillars of strength to support the grand edifice.
Do not be frivolous and casual in attitude;
idle neglect and reckless action will make it impossible to arrive.

Unite the will of all into one;
knowing what you are doing, its greatness can be achieved.
When heart-nature and heart-capacity can flow freely,
there is no fear of trials or anything else.

The temple's purpose: guiding through Dao —
ask: how many take Dao as their home?
Willing to bind their lives to great responsibility —
facing hardship and enduring toil without fear.

*Right?*

With genuine sincerity and reverence, express your devotion —
Heaven will not fail you; the lotus will bloom.
Rise — kneel no more; clasp hands.
With what will you guide all people home?
Looking here, looking there, the heart still clings —
still something cannot truly be let go.

### Commentary

The expansion question for Tong Xin Temple receives the same response as Tong Jie: 眾志成城 — united will. The Elder will not give a strategic plan; the Elder gives a principle, because the principle is what endures.

## Administrator — Tong Jie Temple (同潔壇)

### 原文

（經理問同潔壇…）
凡情是假人事迭　聖心才是真上達
能夠借假修真呀　保持初衷才為佳
咱領使命代天化　不要迷在苦海窪
同者同其道心見　是真的自然不怕
唯恐只是虛飭面　徒呼負負而不察
禮者卑己而尊人　能否扛任助道呀
不負此間前賢勸　自重自愛德性發
　好嗎
請起勿跪行大雅　言為心聲行瀟灑
學著老師走天下　渡化有緣之迷娃
吾因時限言難繼　各自保重再出發
學吾當初立愿後　聞道不捨使命達
　好嗎
言此即止乩管劃　辭叩
Φ娘　共回家　哈哈退

### Translation

*(The administrator asks about Tong Jie Temple...)*

Worldly feelings are illusory; human affairs change ceaselessly —
the sacred heart alone truly ascends.
To use the false in cultivating the true —
maintaining the original aspiration: this is best.

We have received the mission to transform on Heaven's behalf —
do not become lost in the swampy hollow of the bitter sea.
Those who are truly alike share the same Dao-heart vision;
what is genuine is naturally free of fear.

What I fear is only the empty adorning of surfaces —
crying out "failure, failure" without self-awareness.
Propriety means humbling yourself and honoring others —
are you able to shoulder the task and support Dao?

Do not disappoint the counsel of the Elders present here;
honor yourself, love yourself — let virtue arise.

*Is this understood?*

---

Rise — kneel no more; proceed with great elegance.
Let speech be the voice of your heart; let conduct be free and graceful.
Learn from the Teacher's way of walking through all under Heaven,
transforming and saving the deluded children of karmic affinity.

Because time is limited, I cannot continue speaking —
take good care of yourselves, each one, and set out again.
Emulate me: how I once took the vow,
heard Dao, never let it go, and fulfilled the mission.

*Is this understood?*

With these words I stop — the planchette-writer draws the closing line.
I take my leave with a kowtow to the Mother — let us return home together.
Ha ha — I retire.

### Commentary

To Tong Jie Temple: 借假修真 — use the false to cultivate the true. The phenomenal world, the difficult relationships, the interpersonal friction: these are not obstacles to Dao but the material through which Dao is cultivated. The Elder's warning against empty surfaces — 虛飭面 — is pointed: it is possible to perform all the outward forms of Dao without any inner substance. What the Elder calls for is propriety understood correctly: 禮者卑己而尊人 — *propriety means humbling yourself and honoring others.* Propriety is not ceremony; it is an inner orientation toward others.

The final exhortation is the teaching's last and simplest request: *learn from me. I heard Dao, I never let it go, and I fulfilled the mission.* 聞道不捨使命達. The vow the Elder took — one can imagine it, decades ago in another age — is now the model held before the assembly. The same vow awaits them. The choice is theirs.

The Elder's departure is tender. 辭叩 Φ娘 共回家 — *I take my leave with a kowtow to the Mother — let us return home together* — bow and invitation in a single breath. And then the characteristic ha ha, the Elder's signature warmth, the laughter that carries no mockery and every warmth, and the planchette goes still.

What this teaching leaves behind is not a list of instructions but a quality of presence. The Elder has been fully here — to each person, to each situation, to each city represented in the room — and has asked nothing more than that those present be equally fully here: to Dao, to each other, to the work. The teaching's length is itself a form of love. The Elder does not hurry because love does not hurry. And the final image — *a kowtow to the Mother — let us return home together* — reminds the listener that for the Elder, as for all of them, this long journey through the human world has always had a single destination.
