## Step 1: Research — Key Phrases & Classical Context

*Generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro — fresh independent pass*

**佛說彌勒救苦經** — Buddhist sutra naming convention. The "佛說" (As the Buddha proclaimed) opening mimics authentic Buddhist sutras — a common legitimizing device in syncretic folk scriptures. The entire sutra form is borrowed to invest this text with canonical authority.

**彌勒下世不非輕** — Mahāyāna Buddhist eschatology. Maitreya's future descent from Tuṣita Heaven initiates the third and final era of salvation in White Yang eschatology. "不非輕" (not-not-light = no trivial matter) is an emphatic double negative.

**領寶齊魯靈山地** — Symbolic geography. 齊魯 = ancient kingdoms of Shandong — the Confucian heartland. 靈山 = Vulture Peak (Gṛdhrakūṭa), where the Buddha delivered his most profound teachings. The line symbolically relocates Dharma authority from India to China.

**拈花印證考三乘** — Chan Buddhism; 禪宗公案 (*Chan Koan*). 拈花印證 = the Flower Sermon: the Buddha held up a flower before the assembly; only Mahākāśyapa smiled. The Buddha then transmitted the "Treasury of the True Dharma Eye" mind-to-mind — the origin of Chan's wordless transmission. Here, Maitreya repeats and universalizes this gesture: using the flower-seal to test all Three Vehicles (Śrāvakayāna, Pratyekabuddhayāna, Bodhisattvayāna), not only elite adepts.

**天真收圓掛聖號** — I-Kuan Tao theology. 天真 = the title of Zhang Tianran (張天然), the 18th Patriarch; his posthumous name is 天然古佛 and he is referred to in I-Kuan Tao texts as 天真. 收圓 = "gathering the circle to completion" — the final eschatological harvest of original souls before the kalpa ends. 掛聖號 = establishing the salvific order under Maitreya's authority.

**雲雷震開戊己土** — Daoist/Yijing cosmology. 戊己 = two Celestial Stems associated with the Earth phase and the cosmological center. A cataclysmic image: cloud and thunder split open the central earth, disrupting the old cosmic order to usher in the new.

**老母降下通天竅** — Salvationist theology + Daoist inner alchemy. 老母 = the Unborn Venerable Mother (無生老母), the supreme cosmic mother in I-Kuan Tao. 通天竅 = the "Heaven-Connecting Aperture" — specifically the 玄關竅 (Mysterious Pass), the spiritual point on the forehead opened by the transmitting master at I-Kuan Tao initiation. This is not a generic metaphor; it refers to the concrete ritual act of transmission.

**無影山前對合同** — I-Kuan Tao ritual. 無影山 = "Shadowless Mountain" — the formless place of cosmic judgment and salvation. 對合同 = "presenting the covenant seal" — the secret hand mudra (子亥 position at the middle dantian) taught at Dao transmission; it functions as a spiritual passport that identifies the initiate at the gates of Heaven.

**嬰兒 / 鄉兒 / 原人** — Salvationist theology. "Infant souls" / "children of the homeland" / "original souls" — all names for sentient beings who fell from the Mother's side into reincarnation and have forgotten their divine origin. The cosmological narrative is one of exile and return: we are all infants separated from the Mother, now being called home.

**點鐵化成金** — Daoist alchemy; 抱朴子 (*Baopuzi*). "Touch iron — it turns to gold." The supreme feat of the alchemist, metaphorized: the master's "pointing" (pointing to the 玄關竅 at initiation) transforms the ordinary person (iron) into a realized being (gold).

**牢栓意馬念無生** — Chan/Daoist psychology + I-Kuan Tao liturgy. 意馬 = "horse of the will" from 心猿意馬 (monkey-mind, horse-will) — the classical metaphor for the restless, uncontrollable mind. 念無生 is doubly resonant: (1) Buddhist: contemplating anutpāda, the unborn/deathless nature of reality; (2) I-Kuan Tao: chanting the name of the Unborn Venerable Mother (無生老母) — "the Unborn." The practitioner who tames the mind discovers both meanings at once.

**紅陽了道 / 轉到三陽彌勒尊** — Three-Epoch eschatology (三陽劫). Red Yang epoch (second era, Śākyamuni's age) has fulfilled its purpose and concluded. The age now turns to the Third Sun Era — the White Yang epoch — under Maitreya's authority.

**無皇勒令寄下生** — Salvationist theology. 無皇 = "the Unborn Sovereign" — an imperial title for 無生老母 (the Unborn Venerable Mother) as the ultimate cosmic ruler issuing decrees. 寄下生 = "entrusting [the mission] to one who descends into birth" — the Patriarch who incarnated to carry out the Mother's mandate.

**水火既濟 (呂祖師曰)** — 易經 (*I Ching*), Hexagram 63; Daoist Neidan (inner alchemy). 火降水升 = heart-fire descends, kidney-water ascends — the reversal of natural energetic tendencies, the central movement of inner alchemical practice. 水火既濟 = Hexagram 63 ("After Completion") — perfect balance of yin and yang; the Work accomplished. Patriarch Lü's closing couplet shifts the entire text's register: the cosmic drama outside is also the alchemy within. The Great Dao is accomplished when the practitioner's own fire and water are harmonized.

---

## Research Summary — Gleaned Insights

- **The 玄關竅 must be named precisely:** 通天竅 is not a generic "opening to heaven" — it is the specific initiatic acupuncture point on the forehead, the central rite of I-Kuan Tao transmission. The translation should preserve its ritual concreteness: "the Aperture That Opens to Heaven" with capitalization to signal its sacred, specific character.

- **無皇 ≠ 老母 generically:** While both refer to the Unborn Venerable Mother, 無皇 is the imperial register — the Sovereign issuing a cosmic decree. Render as "the Unborn Sovereign" (distinct from "Heavenly Mother") to honor the authority-register of this line.

- **念無生 carries a double meaning:** "Contemplate the Unborn" (Buddhist anutpāda) AND "chant the name of the Unborn [Mother]" (I-Kuan Tao liturgy). The translation cannot capture both simultaneously; "contemplate the Unborn" is the broader and more spiritually resonant choice, encompassing both.

- **天真 is the Patriarch's title:** In I-Kuan Tao context, 天真 is not a generic term for divine beings — it refers specifically to Zhang Tianran (天然古佛). "The Patriarch" is the correct rendering; "the Holy Ones" (v1) was slightly too general.

- **嬰兒 must remain an infant throughout:** The shift in v1 from "the infant soul" to "you who long to return home" lost the cosmological metaphor of exile and return. In v2, preserve 嬰兒 as "the infant soul" — it recurs structurally (lines 19 and 65) and anchors the text's emotional core.

- **The Three-Epoch framework is the organizing spine:** Every divine actor, every cosmic event, and every salvific promise is organized around the Green → Red → White Era progression. White Era terminology must be consistent throughout.

- **Patriarch Lü's couplet is the climax, not an appendix:** The inner alchemy close shifts from external cosmic drama to internal realization. The Great Dao accomplished outside mirrors the alchemy accomplished within. The Commentary must honor this turn as the teaching's true culmination.

# The True Sutra of Maitreya's Salvation from Suffering

*As proclaimed by the Buddha:*

The Sutra of Maitreya's Salvation from Suffering —
Maitreya's descent into this world is no trivial matter.
At the sacred mountains of Shandong he receives the holy treasure,
And with the flower of Chan transmission he tests and certifies all Three Vehicles.
He alights upon the Central Plains, in the land of the Three Stars,
Fully verified at Wang Tao Xin in Sichuan.
The Patriarch gathers the circle to completion and proclaims the sacred name;
Waiting for the appointed hour, he marshals the divine soldiers.

Clouds and thunder shake open the central earth,
And throughout all under heaven, spirits and ghosts are uneasy.
Personally abiding in the kindly heaven — the Heavenly Mother of the Chinese lands —
The Nine-Lotus Holy Teaching returns to the Supreme Vehicle.
The Heavenly Flower Venerable Mother lowers her jade thread of salvation;
Her gathering and transformation manifest in the ancient East.
North and south, the two poles are joined in a single lineage;
The primordial plan of Hunyuan stands at the center.

Heavenly Mother sends down the Aperture That Opens to Heaven.
Before the Shadowless Mountain, present the sacred covenant seal.
The infant soul who longs to return home —
Uphold and recite the Coming Maitreya Sutra.
Recite it with your whole heart, and the Buddha comes to save.
Every golden lotus rises above the cycle of rebirth.

Recognize the Son of the White Era, who comes from the West.
The children of the homeland — at the master's touch, iron becomes gold.
Every day, with a devoted heart, constantly recite and uphold this sutra.
The Three Calamities and Eight Difficulties shall not intrude.
If you wish to attain Buddhahood, bow in diligent worship.
Always keep the heart of bright wisdom.
Do not lend your ears to slanderers and their wild speech.
Firmly tether the restless mind and contemplate the Unborn.

Heavenly Mother sends down the true celestial mantra.
Recite it with your whole heart — divine powers will arise.
All the stars of heaven descend to this world;
The immortals of the Five Directions come down from the Heavenly Palace.
The City Gods of every region come to verify their rosters;
The Spirit Messenger Boys examine all with clarity.
The Three Great Emperor-Officials compassionately inscribe the record;
The Heavenly Bureau pardons sins and saves all sentient beings.
The Celestial Worthy Who Saves from Suffering comes to redeem the world,
Personally appointing the Divine Messengers of the Literary Bureau.

The Eight Great Vajras come to protect the Dharma.
The Four Bodhisattvas come to save sentient beings.
Thirty-six generals march in close formation;
Five hundred divine officers follow close behind —
All supporting Maitreya in accomplishing the Great Dao,
Protecting and blessing the children of the homeland with peace.

The True Warrior of the North stands as supreme general,
Blue-green of face, red of hair — his divine power blazing forth.
He raises the black banner to blot out sun and moon;
Atop his crown blazes the vast array of the Seven Treasure Stars.
His might commands the North; he is the supreme commander.
His armored troops stand ready to sweep all evil clean.
He comes to rescue the original souls — the sons and daughters of the homeland —
As the fire-light falls to earth and dissolves to dust.

The Dragon Kings of the Four Seas come to support Dao,
Each riding auspicious clouds through the open sky.
The divine troops of the ten directions guard the Buddha's procession,
Protecting and blessing Maitreya as he fulfills his mission.

The Red Era has fulfilled its Dao and returned home.
The age turns now to the honored Maitreya — the Third Sun Era.
The Unborn Sovereign issues the imperial decree,
Entrusting it to one who descends into birth —
To subdue the southern fires and return all to the true lineage,
Going forth and forging the true mantra,
Transmitting the Great Treasury of Sutras for the age of Maitreya to come.

The infant and the maiden — constantly uphold and recite.
Evil spirits dare not draw near.
Recite once — great divine power arises.
Recite twice — you will transcend the cycle of rebirth.
Recite three times — spirits and ghosts stand in awe,
And all demons dissolve to dust.
Cultivating through this age of tribulation, seek the path.
Arise in recitation of the true mantra and return to the Buddha's decree.

*Nāmo Tiānyuán Tàibǎo — Amitābha Buddha — ten prostrations.*

---

*Patriarch Lü says:*

If heart-fire stirs and is not yet stilled, it is vain to learn Dao.
If vital water leaks and will not rise, it is futile to seek immortality.
When fire descends and water rises, the eight trigrams turn into alignment —
When water and fire are harmonized, the Great Dao is accomplished.

**Overall assessment:** This translation maintains the text's eschatological narrative, the specific initiatic terminology (玄關竅, covenant seal, infant soul), and the inner alchemy register shift at the close. Key improvements over v1: Patriarch rather than Holy Ones (天真); infant soul preserved throughout (嬰兒); Unborn Sovereign distinguished from Heavenly Mother (無皇 vs. 老母); Aperture capitalized for sacred specificity.

**Recommended revisions:**
- 收伏南閻歸正宗: Consider adding "the Yama realm" alongside "fires" for completeness — but "southern fires" is sufficiently evocative and the revision would clutter the verse. Keep as is.
- 嬰兒奼女: The Final Translation may add a line break to give this pair more pause — "The infant soul and the maiden / constantly uphold and recite" — honoring the neidan echo of the opening 嬰兒.

## Final Translation

# The True Sutra of Maitreya's Salvation from Suffering

*As proclaimed by the Buddha:*

The Sutra of Maitreya's Salvation from Suffering —
Maitreya's descent into this world is no trivial matter.
At the sacred mountains of Shandong he receives the holy treasure,
And with the flower of Chan transmission he tests and certifies all Three Vehicles.
He alights upon the Central Plains, in the land of the Three Stars,
Fully verified at Wang Tao Xin in Sichuan.
The Patriarch gathers the circle to completion and proclaims the sacred name;
Waiting for the appointed hour, he marshals the divine soldiers.

Clouds and thunder shake open the central earth,
And throughout all under heaven, spirits and ghosts are uneasy.
Personally abiding in the kindly heaven — the Heavenly Mother of the Chinese lands —
The Nine-Lotus Holy Teaching returns to the Supreme Vehicle.
The Heavenly Flower Venerable Mother lowers her jade thread of salvation;
Her gathering and transformation manifest in the ancient East.
North and south, the two poles are joined in a single lineage;
The primordial plan of Hunyuan stands at the center.

Heavenly Mother sends down the Aperture That Opens to Heaven.
Before the Shadowless Mountain, present the sacred covenant seal.
The infant soul who longs to return home —
Uphold and recite the Coming Maitreya Sutra.
Recite it with your whole heart, and the Buddha comes to save.
Every golden lotus rises above the cycle of rebirth.

Recognize the Son of the White Era, who comes from the West.
The children of the homeland — at the master's touch, iron becomes gold.
Every day, with a devoted heart, constantly recite and uphold this sutra.
The Three Calamities and Eight Difficulties shall not intrude.
If you wish to attain Buddhahood, bow in diligent worship.
Always keep the heart of bright wisdom.
Do not lend your ears to slanderers and their wild speech.
Firmly tether the restless mind and contemplate the Unborn.

Heavenly Mother sends down the true celestial mantra.
Recite it with your whole heart — divine powers will arise.
All the stars of heaven descend to this world;
The immortals of the Five Directions come down from the Heavenly Palace.
The City Gods of every region come to verify their rosters;
The Spirit Messenger Boys examine all with clarity.
The Three Great Emperor-Officials compassionately inscribe the record;
The Heavenly Bureau pardons sins and saves all sentient beings.
The Celestial Worthy Who Saves from Suffering comes to redeem the world,
Personally appointing the Divine Messengers of the Literary Bureau.

The Eight Great Vajras come to protect the Dharma.
The Four Bodhisattvas come to save sentient beings.
Thirty-six generals march in close formation;
Five hundred divine officers follow close behind —
All supporting Maitreya in accomplishing the Great Dao,
Protecting and blessing the children of the homeland with peace.

The True Warrior of the North stands as supreme general,
Blue-green of face, red of hair — his divine power blazing forth.
He raises the black banner to blot out sun and moon;
Atop his crown blazes the vast array of the Seven Treasure Stars.
His might commands the North; he is the supreme commander.
His armored troops stand ready to sweep all evil clean.
He comes to rescue the original souls — the sons and daughters of the homeland —
As the fire-light falls to earth and dissolves to dust.

The Dragon Kings of the Four Seas come to support Dao,
Each riding auspicious clouds through the open sky.
The divine troops of the ten directions guard the Buddha's procession,
Protecting and blessing Maitreya as he fulfills his mission.

The Red Era has fulfilled its Dao and returned home.
The age turns now to the honored Maitreya — the Third Sun Era.
The Unborn Sovereign issues the imperial decree,
Entrusting it to one who descends into birth —
To subdue the southern fires and return all to the true lineage,
Going forth and forging the true mantra,
Transmitting the Great Treasury of Sutras for the age of Maitreya to come.

The infant soul and the maiden — constantly uphold and recite.
Evil spirits dare not draw near.
Recite once — great divine power arises.
Recite twice — you will transcend the cycle of rebirth.
Recite three times — spirits and ghosts stand in awe,
And all demons dissolve to dust.
Cultivating through this age of tribulation, seek the path.
Arise in recitation of the true mantra and return to the Buddha's decree.

*Nāmo Tiānyuán Tàibǎo — Amitābha Buddha — ten prostrations.*

---

*Patriarch Lü says:*

If heart-fire stirs and is not yet stilled, it is vain to learn Dao.
If vital water leaks and will not rise, it is futile to seek immortality.
When fire descends and water rises, the eight trigrams turn into alignment —
When water and fire are harmonized, the Great Dao is accomplished.

## Commentary

This sutra opens with a gesture of borrowed authority. "As proclaimed by the Buddha" is the opening formula of canonical Buddhist sutras, and its use here is deliberate: the text wants to wear that mantle. But the teaching that follows is not quite the Pali Canon or the Lotus Sutra. It is something more syncretic, more urgent, and in its own way more intimate — a document of the White Era, addressed to souls it believes are running out of time.

The first movement establishes Maitreya's credentials in layers. He receives the holy treasure at the sacred mountains of Shandong — not in India, not at Vulture Peak in its original location, but here, in the Confucian heartland of China. The Dharma has traveled west to east and taken root. Then comes the most arresting image of the opening: *the flower of Chan transmission*. When the Buddha held up a flower before the assembly at Vulture Peak, only Mahākāśyapa understood — and in that single smile the wordless mind-to-mind transmission of Chan was born. Now, according to this sutra, Maitreya repeats that gesture — but universally, testing not one adept but all Three Vehicles at once. The elite transmission has become the final examination. The age of dharma-for-the-few is over; the age of dharma-for-all has begun.

The second movement introduces the cosmic Mother. She is not a supporting figure in this text — she is the axis around which everything turns. Personally abiding in the kindly heaven, she is simultaneously the source of the jade thread (the salvific lifeline lowered to her children below), the center of the two poles joined in a single lineage, and the one who sends down the Aperture That Opens to Heaven. That aperture — the 玄關竅, the Mysterious Pass on the forehead — is the central rite of I-Kuan Tao initiation. This is where the transmitting master "points" the acupuncture point at the moment of Dao-transmission, opening the direct channel between the initiate and Heaven. The sutra is not speaking in metaphor here; it is naming a ritual. And it frames that ritual as the Mother's personal gift — an act of grace descending from the benevolent heaven into this body, at this moment, right here.

The instruction that follows is stark in its simplicity. *The infant soul who longs to return home — uphold and recite the Coming Maitreya Sutra.* The infant metaphor is one of the sutra's most persistent images. We are all infants, the text insists — original souls who fell from the Mother's side into reincarnation and forgot where we came from. The spiritual life is not self-improvement; it is homecoming. This shifts the emotional register entirely. We are not disciplined adults climbing a ladder of merit; we are lost children, and the Mother is calling.

But before that infant soul can return, it must carry two things across the threshold: the practice (持念 — constant recitation, the sutra in hand) and the proof (the sacred covenant seal presented before the Shadowless Mountain). That seal, the initiatic hand mudra taught at Dao-transmission, is the spiritual passport. Without it, the cosmic rosters cannot verify the soul. This is a world where heaven is bureaucratically organized — City Gods verify their regional rosters, Spirit Messenger Boys investigate, the Three Great Emperor-Officials inscribe the record, the Heavenly Bureau pardons sins. The cosmos is not lawless grace; it is administered mercy, and the initiate must know the proper forms.

What follows the call to practice is one of the sutra's most dramatic passages: the mobilization of the entire divine order. Immortals of the Five Directions descend. The Eight Great Vajras protect the Dharma. Four Bodhisattvas ride out. Thirty-six generals march in close formation with five hundred divine officers behind them. And at the head of the celestial army stands the True Warrior of the North — Xuantian Shangdi, the supreme demon-queller, blue-green of face and red of hair, raising his black banner to blot out the sun and moon. He commands the full might of the northern quarter: armored troops, the Seven Treasure Stars blazing above his crown, all evil being swept clean before him. The image is martial and absolute. The White Era does not negotiate with obstruction; it commands a divine army and moves.

Yet the object of all this cosmic force is strangely gentle: *to rescue the original souls — the sons and daughters of the homeland.* The armored troops, the Dragon Kings, the divine procession of the ten directions — they are all mobilized for this. Not conquest, but rescue. Not triumph over enemies, but the gathering home of infants who have been lost for lifetimes.

The text then performs its great temporal pivot. The Red Era — Śākyamuni's age, the second great epoch — has fulfilled its Dao and gone home. The Third Sun Era begins. In this cosmic accounting, even the Buddha's dispensation is not permanent; it was always a second act, and now the third and final act is underway. The Unborn Sovereign issues the imperial decree and entrusts her mission to one who descends into birth — the Patriarch, Zhang Tianran, who goes forth forging the true mantra and transmitting the Great Treasury of Sutras. The cosmic drama narrows suddenly to a single figure walking between worlds, delivering what he was sent to deliver.

The sutra closes with a crescendo of recitation. One recitation, divine power. Two, transcendence of rebirth. Three, demons dissolve to dust. The formula is incantatory, almost hypnotic — it builds to its climax and then releases into the instruction that absorbs everything: *Arise in recitation of the true mantra and return to the Buddha's decree.* The teaching ends where it began — in the act of holding and chanting — but the listener has been transformed by what they have witnessed along the way.

Then Patriarch Lü speaks four lines that reframe everything that came before. He does not speak of mantras, armies, or eschatological eras. He speaks of fire and water inside the body. *If heart-fire stirs and is not yet stilled, it is vain to learn Dao. If vital water leaks and will not rise, it is futile to seek immortality.* The cosmos of the sutra suddenly contracts to the space of a single practitioner's chest: the heart as furnace, the kidneys as well, the alchemical reversal where fire descends and water rises and the trigrams of the I Ching turn into their final alignment — 水火既濟, After Completion, Hexagram 63. When fire and water meet in proper balance, the Great Dao is accomplished.

The teaching is complete. The armies were real. The mantras are real. The Patriarch's descent was real. But when Patriarch Lü takes his four lines at the end, he tells us where the White Era ultimately unfolds: not in the starry sky or the celestial rosters, but in the quiet interior of the person who has stilled their fire and let their water rise. The cosmos is a mirror of the practitioner. The Great Dao accomplished outside is the alchemy accomplished within.
