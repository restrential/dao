### Allusion Notes

**法爾如是 (fǎ ěr rú shì)**
*Source: Buddhist Terminology*
A Sanskrit-derived technical term meaning "things are inherently thus" — the unconstructed, unmanipulated nature of all phenomena as perceived in direct awakening. It points to primordial reality not subject to fabrication or conceptualization. Paired with 原來如此 ("so it was all along"), the verse opens by asserting that what cultivation reveals was never hidden — it was always the case.

**亂返於治 (luàn fǎn yú zhì)**
*Source: 公羊傳 (*Gongyang Commentary*), Duke Ai, 14th Year*
The Gongyang Commentary states that Confucius compiled the Spring and Autumn Annals in order to "set the disordered age right and return it to normalcy" (撥亂世，反諸正). This Confucian political ideal — that the sage's work is to restore proper order — here becomes a personal cultivation goal: the practitioner's inner work brings their own life from disorder back to harmony.

**雲行雨施 (yún xíng yǔ shī)**
*Source: 易經 (*Yijing*), Hexagram 1 (乾 Qián), "Tuan" Commentary*
Original: "雲行雨施，品物流形" — the clouds move and rain is bestowed, and all beings flow into their forms. This is the generative cosmological force of the Qian (Heaven) hexagram — not weather, but Heaven's creative power that gives shape and life to all things. The rainy season opening of 本訓 is set against this cosmic backdrop.

**君子體元 (jūn zǐ tǐ yuán)**
*Source: 易經 (*Yijing*), Hexagram 1, "Wenyan" Commentary*
The Wenyan Commentary on Qian explains the four virtues — 元 (primordial goodness), 亨 (penetration), 利 (benefit), 貞 (steadfastness). "君子體仁足以長人" — the noble person embodies benevolence and is fit to lead. 元 here is the primordial creative virtue, the root of goodness. To 體元 is to incarnate that root quality in one's character.

**可欲善有諸己信 / 充實有光輝 / 大而化 (Mencius ladder)**
*Source: 孟子 (*Mencius*) 7B:25*
This is one of Mencius's most celebrated passages on self-cultivation. The full sequence: 可欲之謂善，有諸己之謂信，充實之謂美，充實而有光輝之謂大，大而化之之謂聖，聖而不可知之之謂神 — "That which is desirable is called good; having it genuinely is called authentic; being filled with it is called beautiful; radiating it is called great; transforming others through it is called sage; the sage beyond comprehension is called divine." The 本訓 follows this exact ladder: 信 → 充實美滿 → 充實有光輝 → 大而化. This progression is the structural spine of the first half of the teaching.

**盡物之性 / 贊天地 / 至誠 (zhì chéng)**
*Source: 中庸 (*Zhongyong*) ch. 22*
"唯天下至誠，為能盡其性…則可以贊天地之化育" — Only one of utmost sincerity can fully develop their nature, then help others develop theirs, then fulfill the nature of all things, and thereby assist in the transforming and nourishing work of Heaven and Earth. The 本訓's movement from personal cultivation to cosmic participation follows this Zhongyong arc exactly.

**泛駕馬 / 躍冶金 (paired allusion)**
*Sources: 漢書 (*Han Shu*) and 莊子 (*Zhuangzi*)*
"泛駕之馬" (the unruly horse that overturns the carriage) from the Book of Han describes brilliant, unruly talent that defies convention. "躍冶之金" from Zhuangzi: molten metal leaps in the forge crying out to become the legendary Moye sword — but the master smelter views this as a bad omen; the metal must yield to the mold. Together, the couplet teaches that even the most gifted and fiery practitioner must ultimately submit to the shaping force of principle (型範) — form does not constrain; it perfects.

**飲水思其源 (yǐn shuǐ sī qí yuán)**
*Source: 庾信 (*Yú Xìn*), "徵調曲"*
Full line: "落其實者思其樹，飲其流者懷其源" — when you eat the fruit, think of the tree; when you drink the stream, cherish its source. This famous line on gratitude and remembrance became a chengyu. In context, the teaching extends it to lineage: respect elders and honor the worthy because we are downstream of their virtue.

**至德至道不凝 (zhì dé zhì dào bù níng)**
*Source: 莊子 (*Zhuangzi*), "Gengsang Chu" (庚桑楚)*
"苟不至德，至道不凝焉" — without utmost virtue, the supreme Dao cannot crystallize or coalesce. For Zhuangzi, the Dao is not a doctrine to be held but a living reality that can only manifest when the person is wholly virtuous — natural, spontaneous, unadorned. Virtue is the condition for the Dao's presence, not merely its fruit.

**篤恭天下平 / 溥博淵泉 (dǔ gōng tiān xià píng / pǔ bó yuān quán)**
*Source: 中庸 (*Zhongyong*) chs. 31 and 33*
Ch. 33: "是故君子篤恭而天下平" — the noble person is earnestly reverent, and all under heaven is at peace. Ch. 31 describes the sage's virtue as "溥博如天" (vast as heaven) and "淵泉如淵" (deep as a spring). The two phrases juxtapose cosmic breadth with inexhaustible depth — the opposite of shallowness or exhaustion.

**萬物並育…道並行不悖 (wàn wù bìng yù…dào bìng xíng bù bèi)**
*Source: 中庸 (*Zhongyong*) ch. 30*
Direct quotation: "萬物並育而不相害，道並行而不相悖" — all things are nurtured together without harming one another; all Ways proceed in parallel without contradicting one another. A statement of cosmic pluralism: diversity in creation and in spiritual paths is not conflict — it is the Dao's design. In context, 後進獻拳拳 follows immediately: the later disciples, grounded in this vision, offer their devotion.

**獻拳拳 (xiàn quán quán)**
*Source: 中庸 (*Zhongyong*) ch. 8*
Alludes to "拳拳服膺" — Yan Hui, praised by Confucius for choosing the Mean and holding it "clutched sincerely to his chest." To 獻拳拳 is to offer that same earnest, wholehearted grasp — not cerebral adherence but the fist-to-heart sincerity of someone who truly holds the teaching close.

## Research Summary — Gleaned Insights

- **中庸 is the dominant source**: More than half the 本訓 draws directly from 中庸 (chs. 22, 30, 31, 33). The arc from inner sincerity (至誠) → fulfilling the nature of things (盡物之性) → assisting Heaven and Earth (贊天地) → peace under heaven (天下平) follows Zhongyong's central thesis. This is not a patchwork of allusions — it is a condensed recapitulation of the entire text.

- **Mencius 7B:25 is the structural spine of the first half**: 可欲善有諸己信 → 充實美滿 → 充實有光輝 → 大而化 is a verbatim adaptation of Mencius's five-stage ladder from goodness to sage transformation. Each phrase must be kept in sequence and given proportional weight; they are stages, not merely parallel epithets.

- **Yijing Hexagram 1 opens the cosmological frame**: 雲行雨施 is not a nature description — it is the Qian hexagram's generative force. The rainy season (雨季萬物生) is Heaven's creative outpouring. This registers the teaching immediately as cosmic in scope, not merely personal.

- **能所 is a technical Buddhist term**: 明悟能所大而化 bridges Buddhist epistemology (能 = subject, 所 = object) with Mencius's highest developmental stage. The line says: in clear awakening, the subject-object split dissolves and the person enters the transformative stage of the sage. This is unique to White Era synthesis — keep the term implicit rather than footnoting it.

- **泛駕馬/躍冶金 is a pedagogical argument**: The paired allusions are not decorative — they make an argument about discipleship. Raw, unruly brilliance (the overturning horse, the leaping metal) must yield to 型範 (form/pattern/mold). Emphasize the word "ultimately" — not suppression, but maturation.

- **Tune 別知己 governs emotional tone**: Bittersweet parting from a dear one. Han Xiang Zi, an immortal, has descended to deliver this teaching and will leave. The close — 後進獻拳拳 — carries the quality of an offering made in the moment before departure. The tone throughout should be tender and earnest, not didactic.

## Step 3: Smoothed Translation

### 鎮壇詩

Thus it is inherently — so it has always been.
In all cultivation, accumulated grime is washed away.
The accomplished person resolves to transcend birth and death;
from darkness, light; from disorder, the return to order.

### 吾乃

I am Han Xiang Zi of the Eight Immortals —
bearing Φ's command, I descend to the altar steps.
Entering the gate, I bow before the Ancient August Φ.
I ask: are all the worthy ones at ease?

### 本訓

How natural it is — the rains come, and all things are born.
Clouds move, the rains are bestowed, moistening every living thing;
gentle qi in its season causes flourishing and growth.

The exemplary person embodies primordial virtue and becomes a model —
personally walking the Way of benevolence, bearing great responsibility.

What is desirable as good must first be genuinely yours.
Then comes fullness: beauty, wholeness, satisfaction.
Fullness brings radiance; one is not far from Dao.

In clear awakening, subject and object dissolve into great transformation;
self and world mutually complete each other.
Harmonious virtue fulfills the nature of all things.
Principle is not dual — all is unified in Dao.
Virtue shines resplendent, illustrious.

Assisting heaven and earth in all ten thousand things —
present always, never absent —
through utmost sincerity the sage becomes manifest.

Begin firmly in goodness; receive and uphold the Three Virtues;
dwell in rectitude and magnanimity.
Penetrate through to the vastness of Dao —
enough to embrace the multitude, virtue reaching the distant.

The unruly horse, however wild, yields to the hand of its rider.
The leaping metal in the forge must ultimately yield to the mold.
All sentient beings will ultimately attain Buddhahood;
the awakened one realizes completion and returns to the origin.

When you drink, think of the source.
Respect elders; honor the worthy.
The virtue and grace bequeathed will flow fragrant and far;
the spirit passed on will continue and endure.

Without utmost virtue, the supreme Dao cannot crystallize.
Earnest reverence brings peace to all under heaven —
vast and broad, deep as a fountainhead.
All things are nurtured together without harm;
all Ways proceed in parallel without contradiction.
With earnest hearts, the later disciples offer their devotion.

| 萬物並育道並行不悖 | "All things are nurtured together without harm; all Ways proceed in parallel without contradiction." | ✅ | Direct Zhongyong ch. 30 quotation; faithfully rendered |
| 後進獻拳拳 | "With earnest hearts, the later disciples offer their devotion." | ✅ | 拳拳服膺 allusion (Zhongyong ch. 8) captured in "earnest hearts"; 後進 = later disciples |

**Overall assessment:** The smoothed translation is highly faithful, preserving the structural arc of the Mencius ladder, the Zhongyong synthesis, and the two classical allusion pairs. Minor interpretive additions are directionally sound. The emotional register of 別知己 — earnest, devoted, tender — is sustained throughout.

**Recommended revisions:**
- In "The unruly horse, however wild, yields to the hand of its rider" — soften the interpretation slightly: "The unruly horse is brought under the hand of its rider." (Less definitive; the original doesn't say it yields willingly, only that it is in the act of being governed.)
- In "Then comes fullness: beauty, wholeness, satisfaction" — consider "Then fullness: beauty and completion" to stay closer to 充實美滿.

Harmonious virtue fulfills the nature of all things.
Principle is not dual — all is unified in Dao.
Virtue shines resplendent, illustrious.

Assisting heaven and earth in all ten thousand things —
present always, never absent —
through utmost sincerity the sage becomes manifest.

Begin firmly in goodness; receive and uphold the Three Virtues;
dwell in rectitude and magnanimity.
Penetrate through to the vastness of Dao —
enough to embrace the multitude, virtue reaching the distant.

The unruly horse is brought under the hand of its rider.
The leaping metal in the forge must ultimately yield to the mold.
All sentient beings will ultimately attain Buddhahood;
the awakened one realizes completion and returns to the origin.

When you drink, think of the source.
Respect elders; honor the worthy.
The virtue and grace bequeathed will flow fragrant and far;
the spirit passed on will continue and endure.

Without utmost virtue, the supreme Dao cannot crystallize.
Earnest reverence brings peace to all under heaven —
vast and broad, deep as a fountainhead.
All things are nurtured together without harm;
all Ways proceed in parallel without contradiction.
With earnest hearts, the later disciples offer their devotion.

## Translator's Notes

1. **法爾如是**: A Buddhist technical term for the unconstructed, self-so nature of reality. Paired with 原來如此 ("so it has always been"), the opening verse asserts that what cultivation reveals was never hidden — it was always the case. Translated as "Thus it is inherently" to preserve this ontological claim.

2. **Φ**: A reverential substitution for 天 (Heaven / the divine), used throughout White Era holy teachings. Retained as Φ in the English per established convention.

3. **老皇Φ**: "The Ancient August Φ" — the supreme divine presence before whom the deity bows upon entering. Rendered as "Ancient August Φ" to preserve both the antiquity (老) and the sovereign dignity (皇) of the title.

4. **Mencius ladder (Mencius 7B:25)**: The sequence 可欲善有諸己信 → 充實美滿 → 充實有光輝 → 大而化 is a direct adaptation of Mencius's five-stage progression from goodness to sage transformation. The translation honors the stages in order without annotating them, trusting readers in the Dao family to recognize the echo.

5. **能所**: A technical Buddhist pair (能 = perceiving subject, 所 = perceived object). The line 明悟能所大而化 bridges Buddhist non-dual awakening with Mencius's highest developmental stage. Translated as "subject and object dissolve" to convey the Buddhist meaning without excessive jargon.

6. **邁取萬**: A textual note in the original indicating that 邁 in 贊天地邁 is used with the meaning of 萬 (ten thousand / all things). Translated as "all ten thousand things" to honor this.

7. **泛駕馬 / 躍冶金**: Two classical images drawn from the Han Shu and Zhuangzi respectively. Together they make a pedagogical argument: unruly brilliance must be shaped by principle. "The leaping metal must yield to the mold" preserves Zhuangzi's image of 型範 (the casting mold as the perfecting form).

8. **至道不凝**: "Crystallize" for 凝 (to coalesce, congeal, solidify). Zhuangzi's word suggests the Dao becomes a lived reality — it precipitates into a person's life — only through utmost virtue.

9. **拳拳**: Alludes to 拳拳服膺 (Zhongyong ch. 8) — holding something sincerely to one's chest, as Yan Hui held the Way of the Mean. "With earnest hearts" captures this fist-to-chest devotion.

## Commentary

Han Xiang Zi's teaching opens in the oldest way: not with argument, but with recognition. *Thus it is inherently — so it has always been.* The first thing said is that nothing needs to be added. Cultivation is not construction. It is removal. The grime that accumulates — distraction, pretense, the habitual self — is what obscures a clarity that was always there. The accomplished person doesn't arrive at something new; they clear the way back to what is.

From that stillness, the teaching turns outward — to weather. Rain falls. Things grow. How natural it is. Han Xiang Zi pauses here, genuinely. The creative force of heaven and earth doesn't labor at its generosity. Clouds move; rain is bestowed. Gentle qi harmonizes with the season, and flourishing follows without strain. This is the teaching's first image of what the practitioner is meant to become: not someone who forces goodness, but someone through whom good things flow, in season, in measure, quietly.

Then comes the harder question: how does a person become like that?

Mencius's answer is the spine of the teaching. It begins with desire — not desire extinguished, but desire purified. What you genuinely *want* to be good. Not performed, not borrowed from someone else's example — actually yours, held inside you like something you chose. That is the first step: authenticity. When goodness is truly your own, fullness follows. And from fullness, radiance. At that point, the teaching says plainly, you are not far from Dao.

This is not the usual account of virtue as discipline and restraint. It is virtue as overflow. You don't shine because you try to shine. You shine because you are full.

In clear awakening, the distinction between subject and object dissolves. The practitioner no longer stands apart from the world, managing it from a distance. Self and world begin to complete each other — each calling forth what the other needs. Harmonious virtue, at this stage, doesn't stay private. It fulfills the nature of all things. The teaching echoes Zhongyong's great claim: the person of utmost sincerity assists in the very work of Heaven and Earth. The personal arc and the cosmic arc are, at their summit, the same arc.

But before the summit, there is shaping.

Two images: the unruly horse brought under its rider's hand, and the leaping metal that must ultimately yield to the mold. Han Xiang Zi is not apologetic about this. Raw brilliance — even inspired, fiery, spiritual brilliance — is not enough. The horse's energy is real; what it needs is direction. The metal's heat is necessary; what it needs is form. The Three Virtues, rectitude, magnanimity: these are not constraints imposed from outside. They are the mold that allows the molten thing to become what it was always meant to be. Without them, the energy dissipates.

Midway through the teaching, a quiet turn. *When you drink, think of the source.* After all the cosmic language — Heaven and Earth, all sentient beings, the sage's illumination — the instruction becomes simply: remember where this came from. Respect elders. Honor the worthy. The virtue bequeathed to you didn't originate with you; it was passed down through people who bore it before you could. Your practice is, in part, an act of gratitude to them. And the spirit continues — not because it is commanded to, but because it is the nature of living things to flow forward.

The close is the most spare. *Without utmost virtue, the supreme Dao cannot crystallize.* Zhuangzi's word is 凝 — to congeal, to precipitate. The Dao is not a doctrine to be grasped or a method to be applied. It is a living reality that either crystallizes in a person or it doesn't. What determines that is not intelligence, not effort, not even accumulated knowledge — it is virtue, genuine and whole. Earnest reverence, quiet and steady, brings peace to all under heaven. Vast and broad. Deep as a fountainhead.

All things are nurtured together without harm. All Ways proceed without contradiction. The later disciples, earnest-hearted, offer their devotion.

Han Xiang Zi is about to leave. The tune he chose for this — *Parting from a Dear Friend* — carries that knowledge through every line. This is the kind of teaching a dear friend leaves with you: not rules, but orientation. Not a destination, but a direction. And the direction is back toward what has always been true — full, radiant, flowing, and inexhaustible.
