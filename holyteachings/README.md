## White Era Holy Teaching Format (白陽聖訓)

White Era holy teachings follow a characteristic three-part structure:

1. **鎮壇詩 (Preamble Verse)** — paired parallel couplets that stabilize the altar and set the teaching's theme; typically 4 lines of 4+4 characters each
2. **吾乃 line (Deity Self-Identification)** — the descending deity announces who they are (吾乃…是也), states they bear Φ's command (領Φ命), descends to the altar steps (至壇墀), enters and bows before the Ancient August Φ (老皇Φ), and greets the assembled worthies (賢士各安舒)
3. **本訓 (Main Teaching Body)** — instruction and exhortation, typically in classical verse, often set to a named tune (調寄) and addressed to a named disciple or group (語寄)

**Notes on Φ**: A reverential substitution for 天 (Heaven / the divine). Retained as Φ in all English translations per established convention.

**Formatting rule**: The entire teaching, including the 吾乃 line, is formatted as verse — never as prose paragraphs. See `workflow-prompt.md` → *Poetic Formatting* for the full rule.
