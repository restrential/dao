### Allusion Notes

**天下為公 (tiān xià wéi gōng)**
*Source:* 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), ch. 禮運 (Lǐ Yùn)
This phrase is the core principle of 大同. It literally means "All Under Heaven is for the public." In the Lǐ Yùn chapter, Confucius describes a utopian past where political power was not hereditary but vested in the community — leadership based on merit, not bloodline, and the benefits of society shared by all. This stands in contrast to 小康 (Xiǎo Kāng — "Lesser Prosperity"), where the world is treated as the private property of a ruling family.

**選賢與能 (xuǎn xián yǔ néng)**
*Source:* 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), ch. 禮運
This four-character phrase means "select the worthy and elevate the capable." It describes the meritocratic governance of 大同: leaders are chosen on proven virtue and ability, not by inheritance. This ensures the state is run by the most qualified for the benefit of all — the foundational mechanism of 天下為公.

**講信修睦 (jiǎng xìn xiū mù)**
*Source:* 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), ch. 禮運
"Cultivate trust and foster harmony." 講信 (jiǎng xìn) means to be trustworthy and keep one's word; 修睦 (xiū mù) means to actively build harmonious relationships. In 大同, social order is maintained not by force or law but through a shared culture of sincerity and mutual care.

**老有所終 (lǎo yǒu suǒ zhōng)**
*Source:* 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), ch. 禮運
"The elderly have a place to complete their lives." Part of a rhythmic sequence describing the comprehensive welfare of 大同. It reflects Confucian filial piety extended from family to the whole community: no elder is abandoned.

**矜、寡、孤、獨、廢疾者 (guān, guǎ, gū, dú, fèi jí zhě)**
*Source:* 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), ch. 禮運
This list identifies the most vulnerable: 矜 (guān) = widowers; 寡 (guǎ) = widows; 孤 (gū) = orphans; 獨 (dú) = the childless elderly; 廢疾者 (fèi jí zhě) = the disabled and chronically ill. They "皆有所養" — all are provided for. The measure of 大同 is its care for those who cannot care for themselves. Note: 矜 here is an archaic character for aged men without wives — not "pity" or "pride" (its more common modern senses).

**男有分，女有歸 (nán yǒu fèn, nǚ yǒu guī)**
*Source:* 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), ch. 禮運
"Men have their role; women have their home." Describes a well-ordered social structure where everyone has a proper place and set of responsibilities. 分 (fèn) = one's allotted duty or station; 歸 (guī) = a place of belonging/return, i.e., a home and family.

**謀閉而不興 (móu bì ér bù xīng)**
*Source:* 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), ch. 禮運
"Schemes are closed off and do not arise." Because society is governed by trust and resources are shared equitably, there is no incentive for conspiracy or intrigue. This leads to a naturally stable order — not enforced by law but emergent from virtue.

**外戶而不閉 (wài hù ér bù bì)**
*Source:* 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), ch. 禮運
"Outer doors are not shut." The culminating image of the passage — a society so free of mistrust and crime that people leave their doors unlocked. Not a statement of fact but an aspirational image: social bonds, not physical barriers, provide safety.

**大同 (dà tóng)**
*Source:* 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), ch. 禮運
"Great Harmony" — the utopian ideal described in this passage: public ownership, meritocratic rule, universal trust, and comprehensive social welfare. The highest aspiration of Confucian political philosophy, contrasted with 小康 (Xiǎo Kāng). Later adopted (and transformed) by Sun Yat-sen and 20th-century political discourse, but in its original register it is a moral and social vision, not a political program.

## Research Summary — Gleaned Insights

1. **大道 → "Great Dao"** (per terminology convention, 道 = Dao — not "Way"). The opening phrase is a philosophical claim about Dao as the operative principle of an ideal society.

2. **大同 → "Great Harmony"** — not "Great Unity" or transliterated "Datong." The political appropriations of 大同 have drifted from Confucius's original ethical register. "Great Harmony" preserves the moral-social dimension.

3. **矜 = widowers** (guān) — this is an archaic usage that does not mean "pity" or "pride." The list 矜寡孤獨 is itself a well-known classical compound in later literature; the translation must get this right.

4. **貨/力 parallel structure is load-bearing** — The two-part "Goods — ...yet not hoarded / Effort — ...yet not self-serving" construction is deliberate classical rhetoric. The English must mirror this; flattening it loses the architecture.

5. **The welfare list has rhythmic parallelism** — 老有所終 / 壯有所用 / 幼有所長 are three rhythmic three-character compounds. The smoothed translation should reflect this parallel cadence.

6. **外戶而不閉 is the climactic arrival** — the passage builds to this single concrete image. It should land with finality, not be buried in a list.

## Step 2: Literal Translation

大道之行也，天下為公。
→ When Great Dao [dà dào] walks/is practiced [zhī xíng yě], all under heaven [tiān xià] is for the public [wéi gōng].

選賢與能，講信修睦。
→ Select [xuǎn] the worthy [xián] and elevate [yǔ] the capable [néng]; cultivate [jiǎng] trust [xìn] and repair-into-harmony [xiū mù].

故人不獨親其親，不獨子其子；
→ Therefore [gù] people [rén] do not only [bù dú] treat-as-kin [qīn, verbal] their own kin [qí qīn], do not only treat-as-children [zǐ, verbal] their own children [qí zǐ].

使老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長，
→ Causing [shǐ] the old [lǎo] to have a place [yǒu suǒ] to end/complete [zhōng]; the able [zhuàng] to have a place to be of use [yòng]; the young [yòu] to have a place to grow [zhǎng].

矜、寡、孤、獨、廢疾者，皆有所養；
→ Widowers [guān], widows [guǎ], orphans [gū], the childless elderly [dú], the disabled-and-ill [fèi jí zhě] — all [jiē] have a place [yǒu suǒ] to be nourished/supported [yǎng].

## Step 3: Smoothed Translation

When Great Dao prevails, all under heaven is held in common. The worthy are chosen to lead; the capable are elevated. Trust is cultivated and harmony is fostered.

People do not love only their own parents as parents, nor care for only their own children as children. The elderly are given a dignified completion of their years; the able-bodied have useful purpose; the young have what they need to grow. Widowers, widows, orphans, the childless, the disabled, the chronically ill — all are provided for. Men have their duties; women have their home.

Goods — people loathe their going to waste, yet need not hoard them for themselves alone. Effort — people loathe its going idle in the body, yet need not spend it for themselves alone.

And so: schemes are foreclosed and cannot arise. Theft, disorder, and rebellion do not take hold. Outer doors are left unlocked.

This is called Great Harmony.

## Step 4: Fidelity Review

| Segment (原文) | Step 3 Rendering | Rating | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 大道之行也 | "When Great Dao prevails" | ✅ | 行 = walks/is practiced; "prevails" captures the sense |
| 天下為公 | "all under heaven is held in common" | ✅ | 公 = public/common; "held in common" is faithful and resonant |
| 選賢與能 | "The worthy are chosen to lead; the capable are elevated" | ⚠️ | "to lead" implied but not stated — minor editorial addition |
| 講信修睦 | "Trust is cultivated and harmony is fostered" | ✅ | 修 = cultivate/repair; 睦 = harmony/amity; both accurate |
| 不獨親其親，不獨子其子 | "do not love only their own parents as parents, nor care for only their own children as children" | ✅ | Preserves the chiasmus of 親 and 子 used as verbs |
| 老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長 | "The elderly...completion of their years; the able-bodied have useful purpose; the young have what they need to grow" | ⚠️ | Parallel structure maintained; "useful purpose" for 有所用 is slightly loose but acceptable |
| 矜、寡、孤、獨、廢疾者，皆有所養 | "Widowers, widows, orphans, the childless, the disabled, the chronically ill — all are provided for" | ✅ | Correct identification of 矜 as widowers; 廢疾 rendered accurately |
| 男有分，女有歸 | "Men have their duties; women have their home" | ✅ | Concise and faithful; 歸 as "home" (place of belonging) is right |
| 貨，惡其棄於地也，不必藏於己 | "Goods — people loathe their going to waste, yet need not hoard them for themselves alone" | ⚠️ | 棄於地 = "abandoned to the ground" → "going to waste" is slightly looser but preserves intent |
| 力，惡其不出於身也，不必為己 | "Effort — people loathe its going idle in the body, yet need not spend it for themselves alone" | ✅ | Parallel with Goods section; faithful |
| 謀閉而不興 | "schemes are foreclosed and cannot arise" | ✅ | 謀閉 = schemes-closed; "foreclosed" is an excellent English cognate |
| 盜竊亂賊而不作 | "Theft, disorder, and rebellion do not take hold" | ✅ | 作 = arise/occur; "take hold" is slightly active but faithful in spirit |
| 外戶而不閉 | "Outer doors are left unlocked" | ✅ | Clean, concrete, climactic — lands well |
| 是謂「大同」 | "This is called Great Harmony" | ✅ | Correct; Great Harmony preferred over Great Unity |

**Overall assessment:** The smoothed translation is faithful to the original's meaning, structure, and register. The parallel architecture of 貨/力 and the welfare list cadence are preserved. The one editorial addition ("to lead") is strongly implied by context and acceptable.

**Recommended revisions:** None. Step 3 stands as written.
