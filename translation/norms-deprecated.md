# Deprecated Translation Norms

Entries that were previously in `norms.md` but have been retired or revised. Preserved here with reasoning so the decisions are traceable.

## 皇Φ — "Imperial Mother" → replaced by "Sovereign Mother"

**Old entry:** `皇Φ | Imperial Mother`

**Reason:** "Imperial" carries unavoidable dynastic connotations from Chinese history — it evokes the emperor's court, not the cosmic feminine. In spiritual teachings, the 皇 register is about supreme, originating authority, not historical empire. "Sovereign Mother" preserves the authority and elevation while shedding the political-historical freight.

## 天命 — "Heavenly Mandate" → replaced by contextual entry

**Old entry:** `天命 | Heavenly Mandate`

**Reason:** "Mandate" is the standard academic translation of 天命 in the Confucian/dynastic context (the emperor's right to rule), and that political flavor persists in English even when the word appears in a spiritual teaching. When a teacher says a student has received 天命, they mean a Heavenly calling or divine charge — a personal mission entrusted from above — not a governmental decree. The rigid 1:1 to "Mandate" was importing the wrong register into pastoral and personal contexts.

**Replacement:** Contextual — "Heavenly Mandate" where authority or decree is the register; "Heavenly calling" or "divine charge" where the context is personal cultivation or mission.

## 佛堂 / 道場 — both mapped to "temple" → split into two entries

**Old entry:** `佛堂 / 道場 | temple`

**Reason:** These are not the same thing. 佛堂 is a Buddha hall — typically a domestic altar room or private prayer space. 道場 is a practice site, often communal and more formally organized. Mapping both to "temple" flattened a real spatial and functional distinction that occasionally matters for the texture of a translation.

**Replacement:**
- 佛堂 → prayer hall / altar room (domestic or private setting); "temple" as fallback
- 道場 → temple / practice hall (communal setting)

## 壇主 — "Temple host" → replaced by "Altar keeper"

**Old entry:** `壇主 | Temple host`

**Reason:** "Host" implies someone who receives guests — a hospitality role. A 壇主 is someone who holds stewardship of a sacred altar space and presides over its ceremonies. "Altar keeper" captures the custodial and sacred dimension; "host" made the role sound social rather than spiritual.

---

## 修辦者 / 修辦 — long description → replaced by inline shorthand + full gloss

**Old entry:** `修辦者 / 修辦 | cultivators who put realizations into practice and help others cultivate`

**Reason:** This was a definition, not a translatable term — it cannot appear inline in a translation sentence without breaking the flow. A shorter inline form was needed alongside the full gloss for reference purposes.

**Replacement:** `修辦者 | cultivators-in-service / practitioner-servants (inline shorthand); full gloss: those who cultivate and put realizations into practice, helping others to do the same`

## 先天 / 後天 — "primordial nature / acquired nature" → expanded with alternatives

**Old entry:** `先天 / 後天 | primordial nature / acquired nature`

**Reason:** Not deprecated outright — the original rendering is still valid — but the 1:1 lock was too rigid. In some sentence contexts, "primordial nature and acquired nature" reads awkwardly, and "innate nature / conditioned nature" is a smoother English pairing that conveys the same philosophical distinction. The entry was expanded to offer both options rather than mandating one.
