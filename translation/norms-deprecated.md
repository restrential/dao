# Deprecated Translation Norms

Entries that were previously in `norms.md` but have been retired or revised. Preserved here with reasoning so the decisions are traceable.

---

## 皇Φ — "Imperial Mother" → replaced by "Sovereign Mother"

**Old entry:** `皇Φ | Imperial Mother`

**Reason:** "Imperial" carries unavoidable dynastic connotations from Chinese history — it evokes the emperor's court, not the cosmic feminine. In spiritual teachings, the 皇 register is about supreme, originating authority, not historical empire. "Sovereign Mother" preserves the authority and elevation while shedding the political-historical freight.

---

## 天命 — "Heavenly Mandate" → replaced by contextual entry

**Old entry:** `天命 | Heavenly Mandate`

**Reason:** "Mandate" is the standard academic translation of 天命 in the Confucian/dynastic context (the emperor's right to rule), and that political flavor persists in English even when the word appears in a spiritual teaching. When a teacher says a student has received 天命, they mean a Heavenly calling or divine charge — a personal mission entrusted from above — not a governmental decree. The rigid 1:1 to "Mandate" was importing the wrong register into pastoral and personal contexts.

**Replacement:** Contextual — "Heavenly Mandate" where authority or decree is the register; "Heavenly calling" or "divine charge" where the context is personal cultivation or mission.

## 佛堂 / 道場 — both mapped to "temple" → split into two entries

**Old entry:** `佛堂 / 道場 | temple`

**Reason:** These are not the same thing. 佛堂 is a Buddha hall — typically a domestic altar room or private prayer space. 道場 is a practice site, often communal and more formally organized. Mapping both to "temple" flattened a real spatial and functional distinction that occasionally matters for the texture of a translation.

**Replacement:**
- 佛堂 → prayer hall / altar room (domestic or private setting); "temple" as fallback
- 道場 → temple / practice hall (communal setting)

---

## 壇主 — "Temple host" → replaced by "Altar keeper"

**Old entry:** `壇主 | Temple host`

**Reason:** "Host" implies someone who receives guests — a hospitality role. A 壇主 is someone who holds stewardship of a sacred altar space and presides over its ceremonies. "Altar keeper" captures the custodial and sacred dimension; "host" made the role sound social rather than spiritual.

---

## 修辦者 / 修辦 — long description → replaced by inline shorthand + full gloss

**Old entry:** `修辦者 / 修辦 | cultivators who put realizations into practice and help others cultivate`

**Reason:** This was a definition, not a translatable term — it cannot appear inline in a translation sentence without breaking the flow. A shorter inline form was needed alongside the full gloss for reference purposes.

**Replacement:** `修辦者 | cultivators-in-service / practitioner-servants (inline shorthand); full gloss: those who cultivate and put realizations into practice, helping others to do the same`

---

## 先天 / 後天 — "primordial nature / acquired nature" → expanded with alternatives

**Old entry:** `先天 / 後天 | primordial nature / acquired nature`

**Reason:** Not deprecated outright — the original rendering is still valid — but the 1:1 lock was too rigid. In some sentence contexts, "primordial nature and acquired nature" reads awkwardly, and "innate nature / conditioned nature" is a smoother English pairing that conveys the same philosophical distinction. The entry was expanded to offer both options rather than mandating one.

---

## 收圓 — "the final gathering" → removed; handled organically

**Old entry:** `收圓 | the final gathering (eschatological/cosmic register); gathering the circle to completion (when the literal 圓 imagery is present); the gathering home (in intimate or personal register)`

**Reason:** Even in expanded contextual form, locking 收圓 to a fixed menu of renderings is too constraining. The term carries rich imagery — gathering, completion, circle, homecoming — that a careful translator should render freshly from context each time. Gemini's Phase 1 research will surface the eschatological meaning reliably. The translation workflow, attentive to the 圓 (circle/completion) imagery and the cosmological setting, will arrive at an appropriate rendering organically.

---

## 彼岸 — "the other shore" → removed; handled organically

**Old entry:** `彼岸 | the other shore`

**Reason:** One of the most standardized terms in Buddhist scholarship. Every translator and every research tool will render 彼岸 as "the other shore" without prompting. No drift risk. Maintaining the norm adds no value.

---

## 眾生 — "sentient beings" → removed; handled organically

**Old entry:** `眾生 | sentient beings`

**Reason:** The single most standardized term in Buddhist translation across all traditions and languages. Any Gemini research phase will surface "sentient beings" immediately and reliably. Maintaining a norm for it is redundant overhead.

---

## 道親 — "companions in Dao / fellow cultivators" → removed; handled organically

**Old entry:** `道親 | companions in Dao / fellow cultivators`

**Reason:** The compound is transparent — 道 (Dao) + 親 (kin/intimates) — and the two options already in the entry covered the range of sensible renderings. A translator working attentively will arrive at equivalent language. The borderline concern about drift (e.g., "Dao brothers and sisters," "fellow Dao practitioners") is acceptable variation rather than a meaningful problem in a living text.

---

## 修辦 — "cultivation" (standalone) → removed; redundant

**Old entry:** `修辦 | cultivation`

**Reason:** Redundant with the 修辦者 entry, which already handles the compound in context with both an inline shorthand and a full gloss. The standalone 修辦 entry added no additional guidance. In running text, 修辦 never appears in isolation from the人/者 nominalization or the longer descriptive context already covered.

---

## 普敬 — "universal reverence" → removed; handled organically

**Old entry:** `普敬 | universal reverence`

**Reason:** 普 (universal/all-encompassing) + 敬 (reverence/respect) is a transparent compound. A translator working from Phase 1 research will arrive at "universal reverence" or a close equivalent without guidance. The concern about drift to "universal respect" is minimal — both renderings carry the same meaning.

---

## 佛事 — "work of a buddha" → removed; handled organically

**Old entry:** `佛事 | work of a buddha`

**Reason:** 佛 (Buddha) + 事 (work/affairs) is a simple compound. The range of reasonable renderings ("the Buddha's work," "dharma work," "buddha-work") are all acceptable and close enough that enforcing a single form adds more rigidity than value.

---

## 六根清淨 — "six sense organs purified" → removed; handled organically

**Old entry:** `六根清淨 | six sense organs purified`

**Reason:** Hyper-standardized Buddhist formula. The Six Sense Faculties (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) and their purification is one of the most thoroughly documented concepts in Buddhist scholarship. Gemini will surface the standard rendering immediately and reliably.

---

## 三業清淨 — "three karmic actions purified" → removed; handled organically

**Old entry:** `三業清淨 | three karmic actions purified`

**Reason:** Same rationale as 六根清淨. The Three Karmic Actions (body, speech, mind) and their purification is a standard Buddhist formula rendered consistently across all scholarly traditions. No translation norm needed.

---

## 後學 — "this humble student" (fixed phrase) → replaced by descriptive rule

**Old entry:** `後學 | humble first-person ("this humble student")`

**Reason:** The fixed phrase "this humble student," repeated verbatim across a long teaching, becomes wooden and formulaic — the opposite of the natural humility it is meant to convey. The spirit of 後學 is a posture, not a formula. The norm was updated to a descriptive rule: use a humble first-person construction appropriate to the context, with "this humble student" as the default and "I, your junior" or a bracketed note at first appearance as acceptable alternatives. The flexibility allows the translator to honor the register without mechanical repetition.

---

## 三不離 — "Anchors / Adherences" → consolidated to "the Three Anchors"

**Old entry:** `三不離 | Anchors / Adherences`

**Reason:** "Adherences" was always the weaker option — slightly clinical, slightly awkward as a plural noun. "The Three Anchors" is compact, evocative, and self-sufficient; it suggests stability and foundation without requiring explanation. Offering two options invited inconsistency. The norm was consolidated to a single primary form: "the Three Anchors," with a gloss on first use explaining that the three are the prayer hall, the teachers, and the classics.
