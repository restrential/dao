修天道

修天道至貴至尊　天地間第一大事
眾佛諸神來護持　千祥百瑞齊降身
群魔眾妖具消退　千劫百禍都遠離
超生了死免輪迴　九玄七祖喜洋洋
千秋萬世不迷昧　天上人間任逍遙

＊ ＊ ＊

天道乃是無價寶　世上有誰知愛惜
諸眾得寶不知寶　雖入道門無真心
馬馬虎虎做表面　應付應付空掛名
人情面子湊熱鬧　糊裡糊塗混光陰
愛舒適又好享受　逞私欲貪得無厭
毛病過錯全不改　說長說短搬是非
為名為利最認真　生死事大擱一邊
為兒為孫做馬牛　無常迅速不關心
燒香叩頭有何用　人在道場心在凡
只說修道心實痴　凡情纏身理不清
虛心假意欺自己　有名無實害自身

良辰佳期若錯過　將再等十二萬年
得寶失寶愚之極　修道不真最可悲
上天有好生之德　奈何你自誤前程
入道十愿不履行　辜負前人苦用心
大劫一到淒慘慘　收殺孽子不容情
到時後悔已是晚　呼天喚地也枉然
九玄七祖同墮落　永壓陰山難翻身

＊ ＊ ＊

修天道就是要使自己脫胎換骨，掃除一切凡病，恢復人人本來清靜無染，光明聖潔的面目，自性天真佛。故修天道，要勇於認錯，時時反省檢點自己，有過即改，即無過。有病即醫，病即癒。無了凡病，即結道果。假使有病忌醫，此病永難癒，終歸自取滅亡。

＊ ＊ ＊

言行不一是大病。滿口道德和仁義，說得頭頭是道，而結果自己的一舉一動，及種種行為卻和道德仁義相背，也無所謂。說某某人不忠不孝，某某人背信背理，而自己的不忠不孝，背信背理卻不知道。勸別人要學吃虧，學忍讓，要看得開放得下，而自己卻偏偏吃虧不得，忍讓不得，看不開，放不下。如此言行不一，最易敗壞道場，讓人把道看輕了，這等誤己誤人之罪，閻官豈能容情？！

＊ ＊ ＊

心窄量小，心計多端是大病。吃不得一點虧，吃點虧就像割了身上一塊肉一樣。聽不進一句逆言，為了一句逆言，可能要氣上好幾個月，甚至好幾年。容不下一件不順心的事，一件不順心的事可能要掛懷許多歲月。心寬恕而面卻帶笑，心實恨而面卻帶慈，背地傷人，搬弄是非。給別人好處，總是忘不掉，希望別人能回報。有過則推得一乾二淨，有功則爭之。為善惟恐人不知，行功到處誇耀。

順言則喜，逆言則怒。心目中只有自己，不信任何人，疑神疑鬼。容不得異己。若見才能智慧比自己高者，必生嫉恨之心。量小福小，量大福大。心窄苦海，心寬天堂。心計多端是鬼魔，心地平直是仙佛。自古成道者，都是心寬量大，心地平直。而四生六道全是心窄量小，心計多端者的歸處。

＊ ＊ ＊

妄貪妄取，自私自利是大病。眼貪美色奇物，耳貪美音讚言，鼻貪香味，舌貪美食口快，身貪舒適美服，意貪聲色名利恩愛。事事斤斤計較，事事想佔便宜。對自己有利之事才要做，對自己無好處之事則不為。滿腦子都是為自己打算，從不為他人設想。為了個人的利益、私慾、地位、兒孫，即使誤了道事，誤了別人的修道，也無所謂。甚至為了個人的利益、私慾、地位、兒孫做出不道德，不仁不義，敗壞道場，使人退道的事，也照做不誤。這種罪過之大，永壓陰山，萬劫難復。

因果報應，天理昭昭，絲毫不差。貪人半斤，來世要還人八兩。貪人一元，來世要還人十角。歷代佛祖都是身心法俱捨，身心法都捨了，何況是身外之物。自古以來，絕無帶私心帶貪心的仙佛。

＊ ＊ ＊

自高自大是大病，自認才能智慧高人一等。自任功高過任何人。對於才能智慧不如者，則加以藐視。別人若犯錯則加以責罵嘲笑。論智愚皆是同一靈源，愚人之靈不減，智人之靈不增，以智輕視愚，己是不明理，不體〈心〉，與道相背。古有訓：「大智若愚」。故自高自大並非智者。古來成道的大佛大祖，皆是謙下慈悲為懷。故恃才傲人，居功自大，目空一切，看不起前人，皆是後天小聰明，並非大智大慧者之所為。

自高自大，人我相重；人我相重難逃閻王之手。尤其目空一切，藐視前人，天理難容。心不想若無前人的指引救拔，那有今天的你？故不報前人救拔之恩，忘本捨源，無論功再大，才再高，也難逃劫殺。

＊ ＊ ＊

不知反省，不肯改過是大病。古聖曾言：「聖人過多，賢人過少，愚人無過。」聖人並非天生就是聖人，而是時時在反省自己，一有過錯及改，久而久之，過錯及漸漸減少，最後近於無過，故一言一語，一舉一動，莫不合乎道。今人修道，鮮有反省自己者，種種過錯，一犯再犯，只知別人之非，說長說短，而不知自己之過。即使知道自己之過，也不肯悔改，反而害怕被人知曉，想盡辦法把這些過錯遮蓋起來。如此過錯越犯越多，越染越深，終歸無可救藥，永壓六道輪迴。

＊ ＊ ＊

心浮氣躁是大病。心浮，定力忍力就差，最易受外境的影響，心隨境轉。見美色、名利則心貪，見順境、讚譽則喜，見逆境、謗譏則怒，得知則樂，失之則憂。氣燥，易動肝火。滿山青翠，一根火即可燒光，天大的功德，一記無明火即可全毀。這就是所謂「火燒功德林」。道場中最忌亂動肝火，亂動肝火最易惹禍，誤了道事，得罪道親，影響修道，帶罪不輕。假使無明火一發，做出欺師滅祖，藐視前人，敗壞道場，考退他人修道的事，任你功再大，也難逃五雷誅身。

心平氣順，忘言絕慮，不被外境所動所迷，則仙佛隨身。心浮氣燥，多言念雜，心隨境變，則諸魔纏身。

＊ ＊ ＊

頑迷不悟，執而不化是大病。以自己的意見為意見，以自己的看法為看法，以自己的做法為做法，自己認為怎樣就怎樣，自認對的就是對。別人的意見，別人的看法做法全不採納。勸不聽，化不開。即使明知自己的意見、看法、做法不對，也不肯承認，硬是將錯就錯，錯到底。明知為兒為孫做牛馬，白費苦心，但卻丟不開。明知恩恩愛愛到終是一場空，但卻捨不得。明知為名為利最傷神，易惹禍，但却放不下。明知說常說短易犯口過，惹是非，但卻斷不了，口癢難受。明知記恨記怨最痛苦，但卻忘不了，那口氣難消。明知動肝火，易得罪人，壞了正事，但卻忍不住，改不掉。

師尊曾言：「不怕迷，只怕久迷，不怕久迷，只怕執迷。」執迷則無可救藥，永沉苦海淵。

＊ ＊ ＊

意志不堅，缺乏恆心是大病。如今老Φ在世界各地遍設考場，每個人都要考，但考題不一樣。有的考酒色，有的考名利，有的考脾氣，有的考情愛，有的考是非，有的考病魔，有的考事業，有的考家庭等等考，不勝枚舉，這種種考中，有的是順順利利的考，有的是顛倒波折的考。有的是成功發達的考，有的是失敗衰萎的考。老Φ為何要降考？玉不琢不成器，鐵不打不成鋼。不考分不出誰真修，誰假修？不考分不出誰是善，誰是惡？不考五、六萬年來的冤債如何能消？不考三千六百聖人，四萬八千賢人如何選出？不考下元會開天地的人種如何跳出？不考怎麼分出誰要壓陰山，披毛戴角，六道輪迴？

這是天地萬物一次大清算。不修、假修者被考得窮兇惡極，橫行霸道，無惡不做，喪盡天良，失德敗道。真修者，被考得窮困潦到，病魔纏身，事事不如意，遭謗遭譏，但道心始終不變。窮就讓他窮，困就讓他困，謗就讓他謗，譏就讓他譏。病就讓他病，死就讓他死，歷盡一切千魔萬考，也不怨天尤人，也不失志退道。

修天道，吃不得貪口福美味，穿不得貪耀眼漂亮，住不得貪豪華享受，行不得貪舒適坐小包車。一切取之簡單、清潔、樸素、方便。並且修天道，要捨名利斷恩愛；要去脾氣除是非；要學吃虧學忍讓；要受冤受屈不辯，受謗受譏不怒；要任勞任怨，好處給別人，壞處自己受。總之，修天道不能有我，不能有私，對世間一切事要無趣無味，退步再退步，平平淡淡，像個大愚人一樣。除此之外，修天道還要接受種種的魔考，如此一來，若意志不夠堅強，缺乏恆心；若不能道心永固，始終如一，則就半途而廢，被冤業拖下，重墮苦海，再無出人頭地之日，萬世輪迴難超生。

對世間一切事無趣無味，退步再退步，平平淡淡，這時凡心才死，這時才算脫了凡胎，這時才開始結道果。道果的大小，要看我們行功了愿的多寡？行功愈多，了愿愈多，則道果愈大。

假使凡病不除，所結的道果有漏。凡病好比蟲子，道果好比水果。水果再大，裡面若有蟲子，就沒啥價值了。水果雖小，裡面若沒蟲子，則依然有價值。若水果大，裡面又沒蟲子，則價值一定大。修天道第一步所以要去凡病，其目的就是要修無漏的道果。

＊ ＊ ＊

Φ恩浩大要知曉　降下天道救原靈
錯過此次大普渡　壓入陰山等一元
九玄七祖齊盼望　盼你莫誤此良機
得了一只要真修　真修真得了生死
切勿馬虎做表面　欺人欺師實欺己
聰明反被聰明誤　凡病不除生死根
切切實行莫空談　言行合一道自成
心窄量小非佛心　心計多端是鬼魔
自私自利與道背　妄貪妄取必輪迴
謙虛慈悲修行本　自高自大罪一等
不知反省迷加迷　不肯改過害自身
心平氣順招吉祥　心浮氣躁惹災殃
圓通應物佛祖行　執迷不悟無藥救
意志不間墮苦海　缺乏恆心道難成
真修真行仙佛助　道果圓滿報Φ恩

### Allusion Notes

**脫胎換骨 (tuō tāi huàn gǔ)**
Originally a Daoist inner alchemy term for the complete transformation of the practitioner's body into an immortal form — shedding the mortal embryo and exchanging the bones for jade or gold. The Song dynasty poet Huang Tingjian (黃庭堅) repurposed it as a literary-critical metaphor for taking borrowed lines and transforming them into something wholly original. In this text it means not improvement but radical renewal — a complete change of one's very nature. "Bone-deep" captures the extremity required.

**自性天真佛 (zì xìng tiān zhēn fó)**
A Chan Buddhist concept closely related to the 六祖壇經 (*Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch*): one's inherent nature (自性) is itself the primordial, innocent Buddha. 天真 does not mean "naive" but "primordially pure/unspoiled" — the original face before conditioning. The teaching that this Buddha-nature is already present in each person, only obscured by 凡病 (worldly ailments), is the theological foundation of the entire essay. Cultivation is recovery, not acquisition.

**凡病 (fán bìng)**
Not physical disease but the conditioned afflictions of ordinary (凡) life — ego, pride, greed, anger, attachment. The medical metaphor runs throughout: ailments must be diagnosed (反省), admitted (認錯), and treated (改過); if left untreated, they kill the practitioner spiritually. This framing turns the essay into a clinical diagnosis of the spiritual body. Render consistently as "worldly ailments."

**九玄七祖 (jiǔ xuán qī zǔ)**
"Nine generations of descendants and seven generations of ancestors" — the teaching that one person's cultivation and liberation carries their entire lineage. Rooted in both Confucian ancestral piety and Buddhist merit-transference (as in the 盂蘭盆經, *Ullambana Sutra*). The ancestors' joy (喜洋洋) or fall (同墮落) depends on the practitioner. The community of karma extends across time.

**好生之德 (hào shēng zhī dé)**
From 書經·大禹謨 (*Book of Documents*, Counsels of Yu the Great): "好生之德，洽於民心" — Heaven's virtue of cherishing all life permeates the people's hearts. Heaven wants all beings to live and flourish. The phrase here sets up a tragic contrast: Heaven's disposition is merciful and life-giving, yet people squander that mercy on themselves.

**火燒功德林 (huǒ shāo gōng dé lín)**
Drawn from Buddhist teachings (found across sutras and commentaries) warning that one outburst of anger destroys vast accumulated merit. The "forest" image emphasizes the disproportion: years of slow growth, seconds of destruction. The Chinese idiom is vivid and specific — render it with the same vividness: "fire burning down the merit-grove."

**無明火 (wú míng huǒ)**
"The fire of ignorance" — from Sanskrit *avidyā*, the root affliction in Buddhist analysis. 無明 = not knowing one's true nature. 無明火 = the burning anger that erupts from this fundamental not-knowing. It is more than "senseless anger" — it is anger rooted in the delusion of a separate self. Render as "blind rage" or "a fit of blind rage," preserving the connection to 無明 (blindness/ignorance).

**大智若愚 (dà zhì ruò yú)**
From 道德經 Chapter 45: "Great wisdom seems foolish." One of Laozi's central paradoxes. True wisdom does not display itself; it appears simple and even dull. The text invokes this to rebuke arrogance: those who parade their intelligence are demonstrating precisely its limits. Retain the received form.

**玉不琢不成器，鐵不打不成鋼**
The first proverb comes from 禮記·學記 (*Book of Rites*, On Learning): "Jade uncarved cannot become an instrument; a person untaught cannot know the Way." The iron/steel pairing is the folk complement. Together they justify the doctrine of testing (考): natural potential requires the refiner's fire. The essay's most extended section — on tests and trials — rests on this pair.

**身心法俱捨 (shēn xīn fǎ jù shě)**
Buddhist total non-attachment: the highest Buddhas abandoned not only possessions but the body, the mind, and even the dharma (teachings) themselves. The argument: if the great masters gave up everything, what possible justification remains for clinging to personal gain? This is the tradition's strongest counter to the ailment of greed.

**人我相重 (rén wǒ xiāng zhòng)**
The thick attachment to the distinction between self (我) and other (人/人我) — a core Buddhist analysis of ego. When this distinction is rigid and heavily invested, arrogance becomes inevitable, and one cannot escape spiritual judgment. The term names the precise mechanism behind the ailment of pride.

**聖人過多，賢人過少，愚人無過**
This paradox — that the sage perceives many faults in himself, the worthy few, and the fool none — appears in various classical ethical traditions. It reverses common expectation: apparent faultlessness is a sign of spiritual blindness, not virtue. The more clearly one sees, the more one finds to correct. This is both a humbling teaching and an encouraging one: faults discovered are faults that can be mended.

**圓通 (yuán tōng)**
Buddhist term for "perfect penetrating awareness" — a quality of responsiveness that meets each situation with fluid, unattached clarity. In Chinese Buddhism it can also be a title (as in 圓通大士 for Guanyin). Here it describes the way Buddhas and Patriarchs move through the world: responsive without rigidity, adapting without losing ground. The direct opposite of 執迷不悟 (clinging to delusion).

**逍遙 (xiāo yáo)**
Directly invoking Zhuangzi's 逍遙遊 (*Free and Easy Wandering*) — the freedom of absolute non-attachment, moving through the world without the friction of craving and aversion. The opening poem promises this as the fruit of genuine cultivation: one wanders freely between heaven and the human world, unimpeded.

## Research Summary — Gleaned Insights

- **脫胎換骨 frames the essay's ambition:** The goal of cultivation is not gradual improvement but complete transformation of one's very nature. This sets an uncompromising standard — anything short of bone-deep renewal is insufficient. The translation must convey this extremity.

- **凡病as the structuring metaphor:** The medical framework (ailment → diagnosis → treatment → healing) organizes the entire essay. Eight ailments are named, each introduced with "是大病" (is a great ailment). The translator must preserve this clinical consistency — "worldly ailments" throughout, never switching to "faults" or "flaws," which lose the medical register.

- **自性天真佛 is the theological core:** The essay's premise — that each person's original nature is already pure Buddha — means cultivation is recovery, not achievement. This makes 凡病 not moral failure but obscuration. The translation should convey this: worldly ailments *cover* something luminous rather than simply making one "bad."

- **九玄七祖: translate with a note, not a gloss:** The phrase is too specific to dissolve into "ancestors and descendants" without orientation. Render as "nine generations of descendants and seven generations of ancestors" at first appearance, then "ancestors and descendants across generations" thereafter.

- **好生之德 is a classical citation:** Heaven's virtue of cherishing life (from 書經) sets up the tragic irony: Heaven is merciful; the practitioner wastes that mercy on themselves. The translation should honor the classical register — "Heaven holds the virtue of cherishing all life."

- **火燒功德林 and 無明火 are a matched pair:** The grove/spark image is visceral and must stay vivid. "Blind rage" for 無明火 captures both the ignorance root and the burning quality. "Merit-grove" for 功德林 preserves the biological/ecological image — slow growth, sudden loss.

- **The six cravings map Buddhist 六根:** The list — eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind — is not arbitrary but follows the canonical six sense organs and their objects. This allusion dignifies what might appear as mere moralizing: the text is diagnosing the structural mechanics of craving, not scolding.

- **The karmic math of 半斤八兩:** In the old system, one catty (斤) = sixteen taels (兩); half a catty = eight taels exactly. The text is saying karma repays in precise measure — not "more," not "less." The mathematical tautology is intentional. Keep the original weights rather than converting to modern equivalents.

- **The paradox of saintly faults deserves full rendering:** "The sage has many faults, the worthy few, the fool none" is the most counterintuitive moment in the essay. Do not soften it. The point — that faultlessness is a sign of blindness — is the pedagogical heart of the self-reflection section.

- **The testing (考) doctrine is the essay's most distinctive contribution:** The extended treatment of why Lao Mu sends tests, and what distinguishes genuine from false cultivators under pressure, is theologically specific to this tradition. The proverbs (jade, iron) should be rendered with their classical weight. The list of test categories (drink, fame, illness, family...) should feel exhaustive, not summarized.

- **意志不間 in the closing poem:** The character 間 (interrupted/severed) rather than 堅 (firm) suggests "a will that is not continuously maintained" — not merely weak but intermittent. Render as "a wavering will."

- **圓通 deserves a specific rendering:** "Fluid and unobstructed" captures the Buddhist sense of 圓 (perfect/complete/round) + 通 (penetrating/unimpeded). It is not generic "flexibility" but a specifically cultivated quality of responsive clarity.

- **Φ / 老Φ → Lao Mu:** Per norms. In this text Lao Mu appears both in the third person (老Φ, sending tests) and as the object of devotion/gratitude at the close (Φ恩浩大, 報Φ恩). Render consistently as "Lao Mu."

### Prose — Introduction

修天道就是要使自己脫胎換骨
→ Cultivating the Heavenly Dao is precisely to bring about in oneself a complete, bone-deep transformation [脫胎換骨]

掃除一切凡病
→ sweeping away every worldly ailment

恢復人人本來清靜無染，光明聖潔的面目，自性天真佛
→ recovering the originally pure and uncontaminated, luminous and holy nature that each person has from the beginning: the primordially pure Buddha-nature within [自性天真佛]

故修天道，要勇於認錯，時時反省檢點自己，有過即改，即無過。有病即醫，病即癒。無了凡病，即結道果。假使有病忌醫，此病永難癒，終歸自取滅亡。
→ Therefore in cultivating the Heavenly Dao: one must have the courage to admit faults; constantly self-examine and take stock; correct errors as soon as they appear — and there are no more errors. Treat ailments as soon as they appear — and ailments heal. Once worldly ailments are gone, the fruit of Dao forms. But if one fears the medicine while still carrying the ailment, that ailment can never heal — and in the end one brings about one's own destruction.

### Prose — Ailment 1: 言行不一

言行不一是大病。
→ Inconsistency between words and actions is a great ailment.

滿口道德和仁義，說得頭頭是道
→ The mouth overflows with virtue and righteousness, speaking with convincing coherence [頭頭是道, lit. "every head is its own Dao" — idiom for speaking with apparent mastery on every point]

而結果自己的一舉一動，及種種行為卻和道德仁義相背，也無所謂。
→ yet one's every movement and act contradicts virtue and righteousness — and one sees nothing wrong.

說某某人不忠不孝，某某人背信背理，而自己的不忠不孝，背信背理卻不知道。
→ One speaks of others as disloyal and unfilial, as betrayers of trust — yet one's own disloyalty, unfiliality, and breach of faith one does not see.

勸別人要學吃虧，學忍讓，要看得開放得下，而自己卻偏偏吃虧不得，忍讓不得，看不開，放不下。
→ One urges others to learn to suffer loss, to practice forbearance, to see through things and let go — yet oneself cannot suffer loss, cannot forbear, cannot see through, cannot let go.

如此言行不一，最易敗壞道場，讓人把道看輕了，這等誤己誤人之罪，閻官豈能容情？！
→ This kind of inconsistency most easily corrupts the temple, causes others to take Dao lightly. Such crimes of misleading oneself and misleading others — how could the judges of the underworld [閻官] show leniency?!

### Prose — Ailment 2: 心窄量小，心計多端

心窄量小，心計多端是大病。
→ A narrow heart with small capacity, and too many schemes — these are a great ailment.

吃不得一點虧，吃點虧就像割了身上一塊肉一樣。
→ One cannot suffer the slightest loss; any loss at all is like having a piece of flesh cut from the body.

聽不進一句逆言，為了一句逆言，可能要氣上好幾個月，甚至好幾年。
→ One cannot take in a single contrary word; a single contrary word may breed resentment for months or even years.

容不下一件不順心的事，一件不順心的事可能要掛懷許多歲月。
→ One cannot accommodate a single thing that doesn't go one's way; one such thing may weigh on the heart for many years.

心寬恕而面卻帶笑，心實恨而面卻帶慈，背地傷人，搬弄是非。
→ The heart harbors resentment while the face wears a smile; the heart truly hates while the face feigns compassion — stabbing others behind their backs, stirring up gossip.

給別人好處，總是忘不掉，希望別人能回報。有過則推得一乾二淨，有功則爭之。
→ A favor given is never forgotten, always expecting repayment. When there is fault, one deflects it entirely [推得一乾二淨]; when there is credit, one grabs for it.

為善惟恐人不知，行功到處誇耀。
→ When doing good, one fears no one will know; when performing meritorious deeds, one boasts of it everywhere.

順言則喜，逆言則怒。心目中只有自己，不信任何人，疑神疑鬼。容不得異己。若見才能智慧比自己高者，必生嫉恨之心。
→ Agreeable words please; contrary words anger. In one's eyes and heart there is only oneself; one trusts no one, seeing threats in every shadow [疑神疑鬼, lit. suspecting gods and ghosts]. One cannot tolerate those who differ. If anyone's talent or wisdom exceeds one's own, envy and hatred invariably arise.

量小福小，量大福大。心窄苦海，心寬天堂。心計多端是鬼魔，心地平直是仙佛。
→ Small capacity yields small fortune; great capacity yields great fortune. A narrow heart is a sea of suffering; a broad heart is heaven. Many schemes in the heart is the nature of ghosts and demons; a heart that is level and upright is the nature of immortals and Buddhas.

自古成道者，都是心寬量大，心地平直。而四生六道全是心窄量小，心計多端者的歸處。
→ From ancient times, those who attained Dao have had broad hearts and great capacity, with level and upright minds. The four modes of birth and six realms [四生六道, Buddhist cosmology of all modes of sentient existence] are where those with narrow hearts, small capacity, and scheming minds ultimately dwell.

### Prose — Ailment 3: 妄貪妄取，自私自利

妄貪妄取，自私自利是大病。
→ Reckless craving and taking, selfishness — these are a great ailment.

眼貪美色奇物，耳貪美音讚言，鼻貪香味，舌貪美食口快，身貪舒適美服，意貪聲色名利恩愛。
→ The eyes crave beauty and novelty; the ears crave pleasing sounds and flattering words; the nose craves fragrant scents; the tongue craves fine food and ready speech; the body craves comfort and fine clothing; the mind craves entertainment, fame, profit, and affection.
[Note: This maps exactly to the Buddhist six sense organs (六根) and their respective sense-objects — a knowing structural allusion.]

事事斤斤計較，事事想佔便宜。
→ In everything one haggles and calculates [斤斤計較, lit. weighing every ounce]; in everything one seeks to gain the advantage.

對自己有利之事才要做，對自己無好處之事則不為。
→ What is beneficial to oneself one does; what holds no benefit one refuses.

滿腦子都是為自己打算，從不為他人設想。
→ The entire mind is occupied with calculations for oneself; one never thinks of others.

為了個人的利益、私慾、地位、兒孫，即使誤了道事，誤了別人的修道，也無所謂。
→ For personal interests, selfish desires, position, and descendants — even if this harms the affairs of Dao and impedes others' cultivation — no matter.

甚至為了個人的利益、私慾、地位、兒孫做出不道德，不仁不義，敗壞道場，使人退道的事，也照做不誤。
→ Some even go so far as to act immorally, without benevolence or righteousness, corrupting the temple and causing others to abandon cultivation — for personal gain — and carry on without remorse.

這種罪過之大，永壓陰山，萬劫難復。
→ The magnitude of such transgression condemns one to be pressed forever beneath the shadowed mountain, with no hope of recovery across ten thousand calamities [萬劫難復].

因果報應，天理昭昭，絲毫不差。
→ Karmic retribution [因果報應]: Heaven's principle is luminously clear [天理昭昭], without the slightest deviation.

貪人半斤，來世要還人八兩。貪人一元，來世要還人十角。
→ Steal a half-catty from someone, and in the next life you must repay eight taels — which is exactly half a catty [karma is precise to the weight]. Take one dollar, and in the next life repay ten dimes — exactly one dollar.

歷代佛祖都是身心法俱捨，身心法都捨了，何況是身外之物。
→ All the Buddhas and Patriarchs across the ages abandoned body, mind, and even the dharma itself [身心法俱捨, Buddhist total non-attachment]. Having relinquished even these — how much more so the things external to the body.

自古以來，絕無帶私心帶貪心的仙佛。
→ Throughout all ages, there has never been an immortal or Buddha who carried a selfish or greedy heart.

### Prose — Ailment 4: 自高自大

自高自大是大病，自認才能智慧高人一等。自任功高過任何人。
→ Arrogance is a great ailment: regarding one's own talent and wisdom as superior to others, claiming one's merit exceeds anyone else's.

對於才能智慧不如者，則加以藐視。別人若犯錯則加以責罵嘲笑。
→ Toward those whose talent and wisdom is inferior, one shows contempt. When others make mistakes, one scolds and mocks them.

論智愚皆是同一靈源，愚人之靈不減，智人之靈不增，以智輕視愚，己是不明理，不體〈心〉，與道相背。
→ Yet in terms of wisdom or foolishness, all spring from the same spiritual source. The spirit of the fool does not diminish; the spirit of the wise does not increase. To look down on the foolish because of one's wisdom is to fail to understand principle, to fail to embody the divine Heart, and to stand against Dao.

古有訓：「大智若愚」。故自高自大並非智者。
→ The ancients taught: "Great wisdom appears as foolishness" [道德經 Ch. 45]. Arrogance, therefore, is not the mark of the wise.

古來成道的大佛大祖，皆是謙下慈悲為懷。
→ The great Buddhas and Patriarchs who attained Dao throughout history have all held humility and compassion as their inner dwelling.

故恃才傲人，居功自大，目空一切，看不起前人，皆是後天小聰明，並非大智大慧者之所為。
→ Looking down on others because of one's talent, taking pride in one's merit, seeing oneself as above everything, holding the Elders in contempt — all this is the petty cleverness of acquired habits [後天], not the conduct of those with great wisdom and true discernment.

自高自大，人我相重；人我相重難逃閻王之手。
→ Arrogance thickens attachment to self and other [人我相重]; heavy attachment to self and other makes it impossible to escape the hand of the Lord of the Underworld [閻王].

尤其目空一切，藐視前人，天理難容。
→ Especially to see oneself as above everything and hold the Elders in contempt — Heaven's principle cannot tolerate this.

心不想若無前人的指引救拔，那有今天的你？
→ Does the heart not consider: if not for the guidance and deliverance of the Elders, where would you be today?

故不報前人救拔之恩，忘本捨源，無論功再大，才再高，也難逃劫殺。
→ Not repaying the grace of the Elders' guidance, forgetting one's roots and abandoning one's source — no matter how great one's merit, no matter how high one's talent, it is impossible to escape the calamitous reckoning.

### Prose — Ailment 5: 不知反省，不肯改過

不知反省，不肯改過是大病。
→ Failing to self-reflect and refusing to reform are a great ailment.

古聖曾言：「聖人過多，賢人過少，愚人無過。」
→ The ancient sages once said: "The sage has many faults, the worthy few, the fool none."

聖人並非天生就是聖人，而是時時在反省自己，一有過錯及改，久而久之，過錯及漸漸減少，最後近於無過，故一言一語，一舉一動，莫不合乎道。
→ The sage is not a sage from birth; rather, he is constantly self-examining, correcting errors as soon as they arise. In time the errors gradually diminish until they approach none — and so every word, every action, conforms to Dao.

今人修道，鮮有反省自己者，種種過錯，一犯再犯，只知別人之非，說長說短，而不知自己之過。
→ Among those who cultivate Dao today, few self-reflect; they commit the same errors again and again, knowing only others' faults — gossiping and criticizing — while unaware of their own.

即使知道自己之過，也不肯悔改，反而害怕被人知曉，想盡辦法把這些過錯遮蓋起來。
→ Even when they know their own faults, they refuse to repent and reform; instead they fear others will know, and exhaust their ingenuity covering those faults up.

如此過錯越犯越多，越染越深，終歸無可救藥，永壓六道輪迴。
→ In this way errors multiply with each commission, the stain deepens with each layer, until there is no remedy — and one is pressed forever into the six realms of rebirth [六道輪迴].

### Prose — Ailment 6: 心浮氣躁

心浮氣躁是大病。
→ A restless mind and a hot temper [心浮氣躁] are a great ailment.

心浮，定力忍力就差，最易受外境的影響，心隨境轉。
→ When the mind is restless [心浮], the power of steadiness and the power of patience are poor; one is most easily influenced by external circumstances, the mind turning with every change.

見美色、名利則心貪，見順境、讚譽則喜，見逆境、謗譏則怒，得知則樂，失之則憂。
→ Seeing beauty, fame, or profit, the heart craves; seeing favorable circumstances and praise, one is pleased; seeing adversity and slander, one is angered; gaining brings joy, losing brings grief.

氣燥，易動肝火。
→ When the temper is hot [氣燥], anger erupts easily [動肝火, lit. "stir up liver fire" — classical Chinese medical idiom for anger].

滿山青翠，一根火即可燒光，天大的功德，一記無明火即可全毀。
→ A whole mountain of green can be burned to nothing by a single spark; merit as vast as the sky can be wholly destroyed by one outburst of blind rage [無明火, the fire of ignorance].

這就是所謂「火燒功德林」。
→ This is what is called "fire burning down the merit-grove."

道場中最忌亂動肝火，亂動肝火最易惹禍，誤了道事，得罪道親，影響修道，帶罪不輕。
→ In the temple, reckless anger is most to be feared; it most easily invites calamity — harming the affairs of Dao, offending fellow practitioners, disrupting cultivation.

假使無明火一發，做出欺師滅祖，藐視前人，敗壞道場，考退他人修道的事，任你功再大，也難逃五雷誅身。
→ Should one give in to a fit of blind rage and commit such acts as betraying one's teachers, dishonoring one's ancestors, holding the Elders in contempt, corrupting the temple, or driving others away from cultivation — no matter how great one's merit, one cannot escape the five thunders [五雷誅身].

心平氣順，忘言絕慮，不被外境所動所迷，則仙佛隨身。心浮氣燥，多言念雜，心隨境變，則諸魔纏身。
→ When the mind is calm and the breath even, words are forgotten and thoughts stilled, unmoved by external circumstances — immortals and Buddhas accompany you. When the mind is restless and the temper hot, words are many and thoughts scattered, the mind changing with every circumstance — many demons cling to you.

### Prose — Ailment 7: 頑迷不悟，執而不化

頑迷不悟，執而不化是大病。
→ Stubborn delusion and rigid attachment [執而不化, clinging and refusing to transform] are a great ailment.

以自己的意見為意見，以自己的看法為看法，以自己的做法為做法，自己認為怎樣就怎樣，自認對的就是對。
→ One takes one's own opinion as the opinion, one's own view as the view, one's own way as the way — whatever one thinks is how things are; whatever one believes is right, is right.

別人的意見，別人的看法做法全不採納。勸不聽，化不開。
→ Others' opinions, views, and approaches — none are taken in. Cannot be persuaded; cannot be transformed.

即使明知自己的意見、看法、做法不對，也不肯承認，硬是將錯就錯，錯到底。
→ Even knowing clearly that one's own opinion, view, and approach are wrong, one refuses to admit it — pressing on in error, wrong to the very end.

明知為兒為孫做牛馬，白費苦心，但卻丟不開。
→ Knowing full well that laboring for children and grandchildren is wasted effort — yet unable to let go.

明知恩恩愛愛到終是一場空，但卻捨不得。
→ Knowing full well that all warmth and love ultimately amounts to nothing [一場空, an empty stage] — yet unable to relinquish it.

明知為名為利最傷神，易惹禍，但却放不下。
→ Knowing full well that the pursuit of fame and profit exhausts the spirit and easily invites disaster — yet unable to put it down.

明知說常說短易犯口過，惹是非，但卻斷不了，口癢難受。
→ Knowing full well that gossip and criticism create transgressions and stir up disputes — yet unable to stop; the mouth itches unbearably.

明知記恨記怨最痛苦，但卻忘不了，那口氣難消。
→ Knowing full well that holding hatred and grudges is the most painful — yet unable to forget; that resentment is hard to dissolve.

明知動肝火，易得罪人，壞了正事，但卻忍不住，改不掉。
→ Knowing full well that erupting in anger easily offends others and ruins what matters — yet unable to restrain it; unable to change.

師尊曾言：「不怕迷，只怕久迷，不怕久迷，只怕執迷。」執迷則無可救藥，永沉苦海淵。
→ The Patriarch [師尊] once said: "Fear not being lost; fear being lost for long. Fear not being lost for long; fear clinging to lostness." To cling to lostness is beyond remedy — one sinks forever into the depths of the sea of suffering.

### Prose — Ailment 8: 意志不堅，缺乏恆心

意志不堅，缺乏恆心是大病。
→ Weak will and lack of perseverance are a great ailment.

如今老Φ在世界各地遍設考場，每個人都要考，但考題不一樣。
→ Today, Lao Mu has established testing grounds throughout all the world; everyone must be tested, but each person's test differs.

有的考酒色，有的考名利，有的考脾氣，有的考情愛，有的考是非，有的考病魔，有的考事業，有的考家庭等等考，不勝枚舉
→ Some are tested by drink and desire, some by fame and profit, some by temper, some by love, some by disputes and gossip, some by illness, some by career, some by family — tests too numerous to count.

這種種考中，有的是順順利利的考，有的是顛倒波折的考。有的是成功發達的考，有的是失敗衰萎的考。
→ Among these, some tests run smooth and easy; others come through turmoil and setbacks. Some arrive as success and prosperity; others as failure and decline.

老Φ為何要降考？玉不琢不成器，鐵不打不成鋼。
→ Why does Lao Mu send down tests? "Jade uncarved cannot become an instrument; iron unforged cannot become steel." [禮記·學記]

不考分不出誰真修，誰假修？不考分不出誰是善，誰是惡？
→ Without testing, who can tell who cultivates truly from who merely pretends? Without testing, who can distinguish the good from the evil?

不考五、六萬年來的冤債如何能消？不考三千六百聖人，四萬八千賢人如何選出？不考下元會開天地的人種如何跳出？不考怎麼分出誰要壓陰山，披毛戴角，六道輪迴？
→ Without testing, how could debts accumulated over fifty or sixty thousand years be discharged? Without testing, how could the 3,600 sages and 48,000 worthies be selected? Without testing, how could those destined to open heaven and earth at the coming cosmic turning point emerge? Without testing, how could it be determined who must be pressed beneath the shadowed mountain, reborn wearing fur and bearing horns [披毛戴角, animal rebirth], cycling through the six realms?

這是天地萬物一次大清算。
→ This is a great reckoning of all things under heaven.

不修、假修者被考得窮兇惡極，橫行霸道，無惡不做，喪盡天良，失德敗道。
→ Those who do not cultivate, or only pretend to, are tested until they become utterly vicious and brutal, tyrannical and lawless, committing every evil, forfeiting all moral conscience, losing virtue and corrupting Dao.

真修者，被考得窮困潦到，病魔纏身，事事不如意，遭謗遭譏，但道心始終不變。
→ The genuine cultivators are tested into poverty and destitution, haunted by illness, meeting nothing that goes their way, subjected to slander and ridicule — but the Dao-heart never wavers.

窮就讓他窮，困就讓他困，謗就讓他謗，譏就讓他譏。病就讓他病，死就讓他死，歷盡一切千魔萬考，也不怨天尤人，也不失志退道。
→ Poor, let him be poor; constrained, let him be constrained; slandered, let him be slandered; ridiculed, let him be ridiculed. Sick, let him be sick; dying, let him die — and having passed through every last trial, he neither blames heaven nor blames others, neither loses resolve nor retreats from Dao.

修天道，吃不得貪口福美味，穿不得貪耀眼漂亮，住不得貪豪華享受，行不得貪舒適坐小包車。一切取之簡單、清潔、樸素、方便。
→ In cultivating the Heavenly Dao: one cannot crave fine and delicious foods; one cannot crave flashy and beautiful clothing; one cannot crave luxurious housing; one cannot crave the ease of a private car. In all things, take what is simple, clean, plain, and practical.

並且修天道，要捨名利斷恩愛；要去脾氣除是非；要學吃虧學忍讓；要受冤受屈不辯，受謗受譏不怒；要任勞任怨，好處給別人，壞處自己受。
→ Moreover: relinquish fame and profit, sever worldly affections; eliminate temper and put an end to disputes; learn to suffer loss and practice forbearance; when suffering injustice, do not argue; when subjected to slander and ridicule, do not anger; bear hardship and complaint willingly, give others the good, take the bad for oneself.

總之，修天道不能有我，不能有私，對世間一切事要無趣無味，退步再退步，平平淡淡，像個大愚人一樣。
→ In sum: cultivating the Heavenly Dao means having no "I," having no private self; toward everything in the world one must be uninterested and plain — retreating step by step, utterly simple and ordinary, like a great fool.

除此之外，修天道還要接受種種的魔考，如此一來，若意志不夠堅強，缺乏恆心；若不能道心永固，始終如一，則就半途而廢，被冤業拖下，重墮苦海，再無出人頭地之日，萬世輪迴難超生。
→ Beyond all this, one must also accept every kind of demonic trial. If the will is not strong enough, if perseverance is lacking; if the Dao-heart cannot remain fixed and consistent to the end — one abandons the path halfway, dragged down by accumulated debts, sinking back into the sea of suffering, with no day of rising ever again.

對世間一切事無趣無味，退步再退步，平平淡淡，這時凡心才死，這時才算脫了凡胎，這時才開始結道果。道果的大小，要看我們行功了愿的多寡？行功愈多，了愿愈多，則道果愈大。
→ Only when one is utterly uninterested in and plain about everything in the world — retreating step by step, simple and ordinary — does the ordinary heart finally die; only then is one truly freed from the ordinary self; only then does the formation of the fruit of Dao truly begin. The magnitude of the fruit of Dao depends on how much we perform meritorious deeds and fulfill our vows; the more we perform and fulfill, the greater the fruit of Dao.

假使凡病不除，所結的道果有漏。凡病好比蟲子，道果好比水果。水果再大，裡面若有蟲子，就沒啥價值了。水果雖小，裡面若沒蟲子，則依然有價值。若水果大，裡面又沒蟲子，則價值一定大。修天道第一步所以要去凡病，其目的就是要修無漏的道果。
→ If worldly ailments are not eliminated, the fruit of Dao formed will be riddled with imperfection [有漏, "with leakage" — Buddhist term for conditioned/defiled attainment]. Worldly ailments are like worms; the fruit of Dao is like fruit. However large the fruit, if worms are inside it has no value. However small the fruit, if there are no worms inside it retains its worth. And if the fruit is large with no worms inside, its value is certainly great. The reason the first step in cultivating the Heavenly Dao is to eliminate worldly ailments is precisely this: to cultivate a fruit of Dao that is whole and unblemished [無漏, without leakage — perfect and undefiled].

### Closing Poem

Φ恩浩大要知曉　降下天道救原靈
→ Know that Lao Mu's grace is vast — she has sent the Heavenly Dao down to save the original spirits [原靈]

錯過此次大普渡　壓入陰山等一元
→ Miss this Great Salvation [大普渡] — be pressed into the shadowed mountain to await one full cosmic age [一元, ~120,000 years]

九玄七祖齊盼望　盼你莫誤此良機
→ Nine generations of descendants and seven of ancestors gaze with hope — hoping you will not squander this precious opportunity

得了一只要真修　真修真得了生死
→ Having received the One [一, the Dao transmission], only truly cultivate — truly cultivate, and truly transcend birth and death

切勿馬虎做表面　欺人欺師實欺己
→ Never be careless and superficial — to deceive others and deceive the master is in truth to deceive oneself

聰明反被聰明誤　凡病不除生死根
→ Cleverness turns and misleads the clever — without eliminating worldly ailments, the root of birth and death remains

切切實行莫空談　言行合一道自成
→ Act earnestly and thoroughly — do not merely speak in vain; when words and actions are one, Dao forms of itself

心窄量小非佛心　心計多端是鬼魔
→ A narrow and small heart is not a Buddha's heart — a scheming mind is the nature of ghosts and demons

自私自利與道背　妄貪妄取必輪迴
→ Selfishness goes against Dao — reckless craving and taking will surely lead to rebirth

謙虛慈悲修行本　自高自大罪一等
→ Humility and compassion are the root of all cultivation — arrogance is a first-rank transgression

不知反省迷加迷　不肯改過害自身
→ Without self-reflection, delusion compounds delusion — refusing to reform, one harms one's own being

心平氣順招吉祥　心浮氣躁惹災殃
→ A calm mind and even breath invite blessings — a restless mind and hot temper invite disaster

圓通應物佛祖行　執迷不悟無藥救
→ Fluid and unobstructed in meeting the world [圓通, perfect responsive awareness] — this is the conduct of Buddhas and Patriarchs; to cling in delusion and refuse to wake is beyond remedy

意志不間墮苦海　缺乏恆心道難成
→ A wavering will [不間, not continuously maintained] sinks into the sea of suffering — lacking perseverance, Dao is hard to achieve

真修真行仙佛助　道果圓滿報Φ恩
→ Truly cultivate, truly act — immortals and Buddhas will assist; when the fruit of Dao is full and complete, it repays Lao Mu's grace

---

## Step 3: Smoothed Translation

### Cultivating the Heavenly Dao

Cultivating the Heavenly Dao — most precious, most honored:
the greatest matter between heaven and earth.
Countless Buddhas and all the gods gather to protect;
a thousand blessings and auspicious signs descend as one.
Hordes of demons and spirits all withdraw;
calamity and disaster keep their distance.
One transcends birth and death, freed from rebirth;
nine generations of descendants and seven ancestors rejoice beyond measure.
Through a thousand ages one is never lost or darkened —
free to wander between heaven and the human world.

＊ ＊ ＊

The Heavenly Dao is a priceless treasure —
in all the world, who truly knows to cherish it?
The multitudes hold the treasure yet do not know it as treasure;
they enter the gate of Dao, but their hearts are not sincere.
Sloppy and careless, they work only the surface;
going through the motions, they bear an empty name.
For social favor and face they join the bustle;
muddle-headed, they fritter their days away.
They love ease and indulge in pleasure,
unleashing selfish desires, craving without end.
Not a fault or error corrected —
they gossip and stir trouble wherever they go.
For fame and profit they spare no effort;
the great matter of life and death they set aside.
For children and grandchildren they labor like beasts;
impermanence comes swiftly — they pay it no mind.
What use is burning incense and bowing?
The body is in the temple; the heart remains in the world.
They only say they cultivate — in truth the heart is foolish;
worldly attachments bind the body, reason cannot reach.
With false humility they deceive themselves;
holding a name without substance, they injure their own being.

If this auspicious time and blessed season passes —
they will wait another one hundred twenty thousand years.
To have the treasure and lose it — the utmost foolishness;
to cultivate Dao without sincerity — the deepest sorrow.
Heaven holds the virtue of cherishing all life —
yet how willingly you ruin your own path.
The Ten Vows of entering Dao you do not honor;
you fail the Elders who labored with all their heart.
When the Great Calamity arrives, how utterly desolate —
the sinful children are gathered and judged without mercy.
When that time comes, regret is already too late;
crying out to heaven and earth would be in vain.
Nine generations of descendants and seven ancestors fall together,
pressed forever beneath the shadowed mountain — impossible to rise.

＊ ＊ ＊

Cultivating the Heavenly Dao means bringing about in oneself a complete and bone-deep transformation — sweeping away every worldly ailment and recovering the originally pure, uncontaminated, luminous, and holy nature that belongs to each person from the beginning: the primordially pure Buddha-nature within. Therefore, in cultivating the Heavenly Dao, one must have the courage to admit one's faults, constantly self-examine and take stock; correct errors as soon as they appear, and there are no more errors; treat the ailment as soon as it appears, and the ailment heals. Once worldly ailments are eliminated, the fruit of Dao is formed. But if one fears the medicine while still carrying the ailment, that ailment can never heal — and in the end, one brings about one's own destruction.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Inconsistency between words and actions** is a great ailment. The mouth overflows with virtue and righteousness, speaking with apparent mastery on every point, yet one's every movement and act contradicts what was said — and one sees nothing wrong. One speaks of others as disloyal and unfilial, as betrayers of trust — yet one's own disloyalty, unfiliality, and breach of faith one does not see. One urges others to learn to suffer loss, to practice forbearance, to see through things and let go — yet oneself cannot suffer loss, cannot forbear, cannot see through, cannot let go. This kind of inconsistency most easily corrupts the temple, causing others to take Dao lightly. Such crimes of misleading oneself and misleading others — how could the judges of the underworld show leniency?

＊ ＊ ＊

**A narrow heart with small capacity, and too many schemes** — these are a great ailment. One cannot suffer the slightest loss; any loss at all is like having a piece of flesh cut from the body. One cannot take in a single contrary word; a single contrary word may breed resentment for months or even years. One cannot accommodate a single thing that doesn't go one's way; one such thing may weigh on the heart for many years. The heart harbors resentment while the face wears a smile; the heart truly hates while the face feigns compassion — stabbing others behind their backs, spreading gossip. A favor given is never forgotten, always expecting repayment. When there is fault, one deflects it entirely; when there is credit, one grabs for it. When doing good, one fears no one will know; when performing meritorious deeds, one boasts of it everywhere.

Agreeable words please; contrary words anger. In one's eyes and heart there is only oneself; one trusts no one, seeing threats in every shadow. One cannot tolerate those who differ. If anyone's talent or wisdom exceeds one's own, envy and hatred invariably arise. Small capacity yields small fortune; great capacity yields great fortune. A narrow heart is a sea of suffering; a broad heart is heaven. Many schemes in the heart is the way of ghosts and demons; a heart that is level and upright is the way of immortals and Buddhas. From ancient times, those who attained Dao have had broad hearts and great capacity, with level and upright minds. The four modes of birth and six realms of existence are where those with narrow hearts, small capacity, and scheming minds will ultimately dwell.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Reckless craving and taking, selfishness** — these are a great ailment. The eyes crave beauty and novelty; the ears crave pleasing sounds and flattering words; the nose craves fragrant scents; the tongue craves fine food and ready speech; the body craves comfort and fine clothing; the mind craves entertainment, fame, profit, and affection. In everything one haggles and calculates, always seeking to gain the advantage. What is beneficial to oneself one does; what holds no benefit one refuses. The entire mind is occupied with calculations for oneself; one never thinks of others. For personal interests, selfish desires, position, and descendants — even if this harms the affairs of Dao and impedes others' cultivation — no matter. Some even go so far as to act immorally, without benevolence or righteousness, corrupting the temple and causing others to abandon cultivation — for the sake of personal gain — and carry on without remorse. The magnitude of such transgression condemns one to be pressed forever beneath the shadowed mountain, with no hope of recovery across ten thousand calamities.

Karmic retribution: Heaven's principle is luminously clear, without the slightest deviation. Steal a half-catty from someone, and in the next life you must repay eight taels. Take one dollar from someone, and in the next life you must repay ten dimes. All the Buddhas and Patriarchs across the ages abandoned body, mind, and even the dharma itself. Having relinquished even these — how much more so the things external to the body. Throughout all ages, there has never been an immortal or Buddha who carried a selfish or greedy heart.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Arrogance** is a great ailment: regarding one's own talent and wisdom as superior to others, claiming that one's merit exceeds anyone else's. Toward those whose talent and wisdom is inferior, one shows contempt; when others make mistakes, one scolds and mocks them. Yet in terms of wisdom or foolishness, all spring from the same spiritual source. The spirit of the fool does not diminish; the spirit of the wise does not increase. To look down on the foolish because of one's own wisdom is to misunderstand principle, to fail to embody the divine Heart, and to stand against Dao. The ancients taught: "Great wisdom appears as foolishness." Arrogance, therefore, is not the mark of the wise. The great Buddhas and Patriarchs who attained Dao throughout history have all held humility and compassion as their inner dwelling. Looking down on others because of one's talent, taking pride in one's merit, seeing oneself as above everything, holding the Elders in contempt — all this is the petty cleverness of acquired habits, not the conduct of those with great wisdom and true discernment.

Arrogance thickens one's attachment to self and other; heavy attachment to self and other makes it impossible to escape the judgment of the Lord of the Underworld. To see oneself as above everything and hold the Elders in contempt — Heaven's principle cannot tolerate this. Does the heart not consider: if not for the guidance and deliverance of the Elders, where would you be today? Not repaying the grace of the Elders' guidance, forgetting one's roots and abandoning one's source — no matter how great one's merit, no matter how high one's talent, it is impossible to escape the calamitous reckoning.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Failing to self-reflect and refusing to reform** are a great ailment. The ancient sages once said: "The sage has many faults, the worthy few, the fool none." The sage is not a sage from birth; rather, he is constantly examining himself, correcting errors as soon as they arise. In time, the errors gradually diminish until they approach none — and so every word, every action, conforms to Dao. Among those who cultivate Dao today, there are few who self-reflect; they commit the same errors again and again, knowing only others' faults — gossiping and criticizing — while unaware of their own. Even when they know their own faults, they refuse to repent and reform; instead they fear others will know, and exhaust their ingenuity covering those faults up. In this way errors multiply with each commission, the stain deepens with each layer, until there is no remedy — and one is pressed forever into the six realms of rebirth.

＊ ＊ ＊

**A restless mind and a hot temper** are a great ailment. When the mind is restless, the power of steadiness and the power of patience are poor; one is most easily swayed by external circumstances, the mind turning with every change. Seeing beauty, fame, or profit, the heart fills with craving; seeing favorable circumstances and praise, one is pleased; seeing adversity and slander, one is angered; gaining brings joy, losing brings grief. When the temper is hot, anger erupts easily. A whole mountain of green can be burned to nothing by a single spark; merit as vast as the sky can be wholly destroyed by one outburst of blind rage. This is what is called "fire burning down the merit-grove." In the temple, reckless anger is most to be feared; it most easily invites calamity — harming the affairs of Dao, offending fellow practitioners, disrupting cultivation. Should one give in to a fit of blind rage and commit such acts as betraying one's teachers, dishonoring one's ancestors, holding the Elders in contempt, corrupting the temple, or driving others away from cultivation — no matter how great one's merit, one cannot escape the five thunders.

When the mind is calm and the breath even, words are forgotten and thoughts stilled, unmoved by external circumstances — immortals and Buddhas accompany you. When the mind is restless and the temper hot, words are many and thoughts scattered, the mind changing with every circumstance — many demons cling to you.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Stubborn delusion and rigid attachment** are a great ailment. One takes one's own opinion as the opinion, one's own view as the view, one's own approach as the approach — whatever one thinks is how things are; whatever one believes to be right, is right. Others' opinions, views, and approaches — none are taken in. One cannot be persuaded; one cannot be transformed. Even knowing clearly that one's own opinion, view, and approach are wrong, one refuses to admit it — pressing on in error, wrong to the very end. Knowing full well that laboring for children and grandchildren is wasted effort — yet unable to let go. Knowing full well that all warmth and love ultimately amounts to nothing — yet unable to relinquish it. Knowing full well that the pursuit of fame and profit exhausts the spirit and easily invites disaster — yet unable to put it down. Knowing full well that gossip and criticism create transgressions and stir up disputes — yet unable to stop; the mouth itches unbearably. Knowing full well that holding hatred and grudges is the most painful — yet unable to forget; that resentment is hard to dissolve. Knowing full well that erupting in anger easily offends others and ruins what matters — yet unable to restrain it; unable to change.

The Patriarch once said: "Fear not being lost; fear being lost for long. Fear not being lost for long; fear clinging to lostness." To cling to lostness is beyond remedy — one sinks forever into the depths of the sea of suffering.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Weak will and lack of perseverance** are a great ailment. Today, Lao Mu has established testing grounds throughout all the world; everyone must be tested, but each person's test differs. Some are tested by drink and desire, some by fame and profit, some by temper, some by love, some by disputes and gossip, some by illness, some by career, some by family — tests too numerous to count. Among these, some tests run smooth and easy; others come through turmoil and setbacks. Some arrive as success and prosperity; others as failure and decline. Why does Lao Mu send down tests? "Jade uncarved cannot become an instrument; iron unforged cannot become steel." Without testing, who can tell who cultivates truly from who merely pretends? Without testing, who can distinguish the good from the evil? Without testing, how could the debts accumulated over fifty or sixty thousand years be discharged? Without testing, how could the 3,600 sages and 48,000 worthies be selected? Without testing, how could those destined to open heaven and earth at the coming cosmic turning point emerge? Without testing, how could it be determined who must be pressed beneath the shadowed mountain, reborn wearing fur and bearing horns, cycling through the six realms?

This is a great reckoning of all things under heaven. Those who do not cultivate, or only pretend to, are tested until they become utterly vicious and brutal, tyrannical and lawless, committing every evil, forfeiting all moral conscience, losing virtue and corrupting Dao. The genuine cultivators are tested into poverty and destitution, haunted by illness, meeting nothing that goes their way, subjected to slander and ridicule — but the Dao-heart never wavers. Poor, let him be poor; constrained, let him be constrained; slandered, let him be slandered; ridiculed, let him be ridiculed. Sick, let him be sick; dying, let him die — and having passed through every last trial, he neither blames heaven nor blames others, neither loses resolve nor retreats from Dao.

In cultivating the Heavenly Dao: one cannot crave fine food; one cannot crave beautiful clothing; one cannot crave luxurious housing; one cannot crave ease and comfort. In all things, take what is simple, clean, plain, and practical. Moreover: relinquish fame and profit, sever worldly affections; eliminate temper and put an end to disputes; learn to suffer loss and practice forbearance; when suffering injustice, do not argue; when subjected to slander and ridicule, do not anger; bear hardship and complaint willingly, give others the good, take the bad for oneself. In sum: cultivating the Heavenly Dao means having no "I," having no private self; toward everything in the world one must be uninterested and plain — retreating step by step, utterly simple and ordinary, like a great fool. Beyond all this, one must also accept every kind of demonic trial. If the will is not strong enough, if perseverance is lacking; if the Dao-heart cannot remain fixed and consistent to the end — one abandons the path halfway, dragged down by the weight of accumulated debts, sinking back into the sea of suffering, with no day of rising ever again.

Only when one is utterly uninterested in and plain about everything in the world — retreating step by step, simple and ordinary — does the ordinary heart finally die; only then is one truly freed from the ordinary self; only then does the formation of the fruit of Dao truly begin. The magnitude of the fruit of Dao depends on how much we perform meritorious deeds and fulfill our vows; the more we perform and fulfill, the greater the fruit of Dao.

If worldly ailments are not eliminated, the fruit of Dao formed will be riddled with imperfection. Worldly ailments are like worms; the fruit of Dao is like fruit. However large the fruit, if worms are inside it has no value. However small the fruit, if there are no worms inside it retains its worth. And if the fruit is large with no worms inside, its value is certainly great. The reason the first step in cultivating the Heavenly Dao is to eliminate worldly ailments is precisely this: to cultivate a fruit of Dao that is whole and unblemished.

＊ ＊ ＊

Know that Lao Mu's grace is vast —
she has sent the Heavenly Dao to save the original spirits.
Miss this Great Salvation —
and be pressed into the shadowed mountain to await a full cosmic age.
Nine generations of descendants and seven ancestors gaze with hope —
hoping you will not squander this precious opportunity.
Having received the transmission, only truly cultivate —
truly cultivate, and truly transcend birth and death.
Never be careless and superficial —
to deceive others and deceive the master is in truth to deceive oneself.
Cleverness turns and misleads the clever —
without eliminating worldly ailments, the root of birth and death remains.
Act earnestly — do not speak in vain;
when words and actions are one, Dao forms of itself.
A narrow and small heart is not a Buddha's heart;
a scheming mind is the way of ghosts and demons.
Selfishness goes against Dao;
reckless craving and taking will surely lead to rebirth.
Humility and compassion are the root of all cultivation;
arrogance is a first-rank transgression.
Without self-reflection, delusion compounds delusion;
refusing to reform, one harms one's own being.
A calm mind and even breath invite blessings;
a restless mind and hot temper invite disaster.
Fluid and unobstructed in meeting the world — this is the conduct of Buddhas and Patriarchs;
to cling in delusion and refuse to wake is beyond remedy.
A wavering will sinks into the sea of suffering;
lacking perseverance, Dao is hard to achieve.
Truly cultivate, truly act — and immortals and Buddhas will help;
when the fruit of Dao is full and complete, it repays Lao Mu's grace.

## Final Translation

### Cultivating the Heavenly Dao

Cultivating the Heavenly Dao — most precious, most honored:
the greatest matter between heaven and earth.
Countless Buddhas and all the gods gather to protect;
a thousand blessings and auspicious signs descend as one.
Hordes of demons and spirits all withdraw;
calamity and disaster keep their distance.
One transcends birth and death, freed from rebirth;
nine generations of descendants and seven ancestors rejoice beyond measure.
Through a thousand ages one is never lost or darkened —
free to wander between heaven and the human world.

＊ ＊ ＊

The Heavenly Dao is a priceless treasure —
in all the world, who truly knows to cherish it?
The multitudes hold the treasure yet do not know it as treasure;
they enter the gate of Dao, but their hearts are not sincere.
Sloppy and careless, they work only the surface;
going through the motions, they bear an empty name.
For social favor and face they join the bustle;
muddle-headed, they fritter their days away.
They love ease and indulge in pleasure,
unleashing selfish desires, craving without end.
Not a fault or error corrected —
they gossip and stir trouble wherever they go.
For fame and profit they spare no effort;
the great matter of life and death they set aside.
For children and grandchildren they labor like beasts;
impermanence comes swiftly — they pay it no mind.
What use is burning incense and bowing?
The body is in the temple; the heart remains in the world.
They only say they cultivate — in truth the heart is foolish;
worldly attachments bind the body, reason cannot reach.
With false humility they deceive themselves;
holding a name without substance, they injure their own being.

If this auspicious time and blessed season passes —
they will wait another one hundred twenty thousand years.
To have the treasure and lose it — the utmost foolishness;
to cultivate Dao without sincerity — the deepest sorrow.
Heaven holds the virtue of cherishing all life —
yet how willingly you ruin your own path.
The Ten Vows of entering Dao you do not honor;
you fail the Elders who labored with all their heart.
When the Great Calamity arrives, how utterly desolate —
the sinful children are gathered and judged without mercy.
When that time comes, regret is already too late;
crying out to heaven and earth would be in vain.
Nine generations of descendants and seven ancestors fall together,
pressed forever beneath the shadowed mountain — impossible to rise.

＊ ＊ ＊

Cultivating the Heavenly Dao means bringing about in oneself a complete and bone-deep transformation — sweeping away every worldly ailment and recovering the originally pure, uncontaminated, luminous, and holy nature that belongs to each person from the beginning: the primordially pure Buddha-nature within. Therefore, in cultivating the Heavenly Dao, one must have the courage to admit one's faults, constantly self-examine and take stock; correct errors as soon as they appear, and there are no more errors; treat the ailment as soon as it appears, and the ailment heals. Once worldly ailments are eliminated, the fruit of Dao is formed. But if one fears the medicine while still carrying the ailment, that ailment can never heal — and in the end, one brings about one's own destruction.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Inconsistency between words and actions** is a great ailment. The mouth overflows with virtue and righteousness, speaking with apparent mastery on every point, yet one's every movement and act contradicts what was said — and one sees nothing wrong. One speaks of others as disloyal and unfilial, as betrayers of trust — yet one's own disloyalty, unfiliality, and breach of faith one does not see. One urges others to learn to suffer loss, to practice forbearance, to see through things and let go — yet oneself cannot suffer loss, cannot forbear, cannot see through, cannot let go. This kind of inconsistency most easily corrupts the temple, causing others to take Dao lightly. Such crimes of misleading oneself and misleading others — how could the judges of the underworld show leniency?

＊ ＊ ＊

**A narrow heart with small capacity, and too many schemes** — these are a great ailment. One cannot suffer the slightest loss; any loss at all is like having a piece of flesh cut from the body. One cannot take in a single contrary word; a single contrary word may breed resentment for months or even years. One cannot accommodate a single thing that doesn't go one's way; one such thing may weigh on the heart for many years. The heart harbors resentment while the face wears a smile; the heart truly hates while the face feigns compassion — stabbing others behind their backs, spreading gossip. A favor given is never forgotten, always expecting repayment. When there is fault, one deflects it entirely; when there is credit, one grabs for it. When doing good, one fears no one will know; when performing meritorious deeds, one boasts of it everywhere.

Agreeable words please; contrary words anger. In one's eyes and heart there is only oneself; one trusts no one, seeing threats in every shadow. One cannot tolerate those who differ. If anyone's talent or wisdom exceeds one's own, envy and hatred invariably arise. Small capacity yields small fortune; great capacity yields great fortune. A narrow heart is a sea of suffering; a broad heart is heaven. Many schemes in the heart is the way of ghosts and demons; a heart that is level and upright is the way of immortals and Buddhas. From ancient times, those who attained Dao have had broad hearts and great capacity, with level and upright minds. The four modes of birth and six realms of existence are where those with narrow hearts, small capacity, and scheming minds will ultimately dwell.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Reckless craving and taking, selfishness** — these are a great ailment. The eyes crave beauty and novelty; the ears crave pleasing sounds and flattering words; the nose craves fragrant scents; the tongue craves fine food and ready speech; the body craves comfort and fine clothing; the mind craves entertainment, fame, profit, and affection. In everything one haggles and calculates, always seeking to gain the advantage. What is beneficial to oneself one does; what holds no benefit one refuses. The entire mind is occupied with calculations for oneself; one never thinks of others. For personal interests, selfish desires, position, and descendants — even if this harms the affairs of Dao and impedes others' cultivation — no matter. Some even go so far as to act immorally, without benevolence or righteousness, corrupting the temple and causing others to abandon cultivation — for the sake of personal gain — and carry on without remorse. The magnitude of such transgression condemns one to be pressed forever beneath the shadowed mountain, with no hope of recovery across ten thousand calamities.

Karmic retribution: Heaven's principle is luminously clear, without the slightest deviation. Steal a half-catty from someone, and in the next life you must repay eight taels. Take one dollar from someone, and in the next life you must repay ten dimes. All the Buddhas and Patriarchs across the ages abandoned body, mind, and even the dharma itself. Having relinquished even these — how much more so the things external to the body. Throughout all ages, there has never been an immortal or Buddha who carried a selfish or greedy heart.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Arrogance** is a great ailment: regarding one's own talent and wisdom as superior to others, claiming that one's merit exceeds anyone else's. Toward those whose talent and wisdom is inferior, one shows contempt; when others make mistakes, one scolds and mocks them. Yet in terms of wisdom or foolishness, all spring from the same spiritual source. The spirit of the fool does not diminish; the spirit of the wise does not increase. To look down on the foolish because of one's own wisdom is to misunderstand principle, to fail to embody the divine Heart, and to stand against Dao. The ancients taught: "Great wisdom appears as foolishness." Arrogance, therefore, is not the mark of the wise. The great Buddhas and Patriarchs who attained Dao throughout history have all held humility and compassion as their inner dwelling. Looking down on others because of one's talent, taking pride in one's merit, seeing oneself as above everything, holding the Elders in contempt — all this is the petty cleverness of acquired habits, not the conduct of those with great wisdom and true discernment.

Arrogance thickens one's attachment to self and other; heavy attachment to self and other makes it impossible to escape the judgment of the Lord of the Underworld. To see oneself as above everything and hold the Elders in contempt — Heaven's principle cannot tolerate this. Does the heart not consider: if not for the guidance and deliverance of the Elders, where would you be today? Not repaying the grace of the Elders' guidance, forgetting one's roots and abandoning one's source — no matter how great one's merit, no matter how high one's talent, it is impossible to escape the calamitous reckoning.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Failing to self-reflect and refusing to reform** are a great ailment. The ancient sages once said: "The sage has many faults, the worthy few, the fool none." The sage is not a sage from birth; rather, he is constantly examining himself, correcting errors as soon as they arise. In time, the errors gradually diminish until they approach none — and so every word, every action, conforms to Dao. Among those who cultivate Dao today, there are few who self-reflect; they commit the same errors again and again, knowing only others' faults — gossiping and criticizing — while unaware of their own. Even when they know their own faults, they refuse to repent and reform; instead they fear others will know, and exhaust their ingenuity covering those faults up. In this way errors multiply with each commission, the stain deepens with each layer, until there is no remedy — and one is pressed forever into the six realms of rebirth.

＊ ＊ ＊

**A restless mind and a hot temper** are a great ailment. When the mind is restless, the power of steadiness and the power of patience are poor; one is most easily swayed by external circumstances, the mind turning with every change. Seeing beauty, fame, or profit, the heart fills with craving; seeing favorable circumstances and praise, one is pleased; seeing adversity and slander, one is angered; gaining brings joy, losing brings grief. When the temper is hot, anger erupts easily. A whole mountain of green can be burned to nothing by a single spark; merit as vast as the sky can be wholly destroyed by one outburst of blind rage. This is what is called "fire burning down the merit-grove." In the temple, reckless anger is most to be feared; it most easily invites calamity — harming the affairs of Dao, offending fellow practitioners, disrupting cultivation. Should one give in to a fit of blind rage and commit such acts as betraying one's teachers, dishonoring one's ancestors, holding the Elders in contempt, corrupting the temple, or driving others away from cultivation — no matter how great one's merit, one cannot escape the five thunders.

When the mind is calm and the breath even, words are forgotten and thoughts stilled, unmoved by external circumstances — immortals and Buddhas accompany you. When the mind is restless and the temper hot, words are many and thoughts scattered, the mind changing with every circumstance — many demons cling to you.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Stubborn delusion and rigid attachment** are a great ailment. One takes one's own opinion as the opinion, one's own view as the view, one's own approach as the approach — whatever one thinks is how things are; whatever one believes to be right, is right. Others' opinions, views, and approaches — none are taken in. One cannot be persuaded; one cannot be transformed. Even knowing clearly that one's own opinion, view, and approach are wrong, one refuses to admit it — pressing on in error, wrong to the very end. Knowing full well that laboring for children and grandchildren is wasted effort — yet unable to let go. Knowing full well that all warmth and love ultimately amounts to nothing — yet unable to relinquish it. Knowing full well that the pursuit of fame and profit exhausts the spirit and easily invites disaster — yet unable to put it down. Knowing full well that gossip and criticism create transgressions and stir up disputes — yet unable to stop; the mouth itches unbearably. Knowing full well that holding hatred and grudges is the most painful — yet unable to forget; that resentment is hard to dissolve. Knowing full well that erupting in anger easily offends others and ruins what matters — yet unable to restrain it; unable to change.

The Patriarch once said: "Fear not being lost; fear being lost for long. Fear not being lost for long; fear clinging to lostness." To cling to lostness is beyond remedy — one sinks forever into the depths of the sea of suffering.

＊ ＊ ＊

**Weak will and lack of perseverance** are a great ailment. Today, Lao Mu has established testing grounds throughout all the world; everyone must be tested, but each person's test differs. Some are tested by drink and desire, some by fame and profit, some by temper, some by love, some by disputes and gossip, some by illness, some by career, some by family — tests too numerous to count. Among these, some tests run smooth and easy; others come through turmoil and setbacks. Some arrive as success and prosperity; others as failure and decline. Why does Lao Mu send down tests? "Jade uncarved cannot become an instrument; iron unforged cannot become steel." Without testing, who can tell who cultivates truly from who merely pretends? Without testing, who can distinguish the good from the evil? Without testing, how could the debts accumulated over fifty or sixty thousand years be discharged? Without testing, how could the 3,600 sages and 48,000 worthies be selected? Without testing, how could those destined to open heaven and earth at the coming cosmic turning point emerge? Without testing, how could it be determined who must be pressed beneath the shadowed mountain, reborn wearing fur and bearing horns, cycling through the six realms?

This is a great reckoning of all things under heaven. Those who do not cultivate, or only pretend to, are tested until they become utterly vicious and brutal, tyrannical and lawless, committing every evil, forfeiting all moral conscience, losing virtue and corrupting Dao. The genuine cultivators are tested into poverty and destitution, haunted by illness, meeting nothing that goes their way, subjected to slander and ridicule — but the Dao-heart never wavers. Poor, let him be poor; constrained, let him be constrained; slandered, let him be slandered; ridiculed, let him be ridiculed. Sick, let him be sick; dying, let him die — and having passed through every last trial, he neither blames heaven nor blames others, neither loses resolve nor retreats from Dao.

In cultivating the Heavenly Dao: one cannot crave fine food; one cannot crave beautiful clothing; one cannot crave luxurious housing; one cannot crave ease and comfort. In all things, take what is simple, clean, plain, and practical. Moreover: relinquish fame and profit, sever worldly affections; eliminate temper and put an end to disputes; learn to suffer loss and practice forbearance; when suffering injustice, do not argue; when subjected to slander and ridicule, do not anger; bear hardship and complaint willingly, give others the good, take the bad for oneself. In sum: cultivating the Heavenly Dao means having no "I," having no private self; toward everything in the world one must be uninterested and plain — retreating step by step, utterly simple and ordinary, like a great fool. Beyond all this, one must also accept every kind of demonic trial. If the will is not strong enough, if perseverance is lacking; if the Dao-heart cannot remain fixed and consistent to the end — one abandons the path halfway, dragged down by the weight of accumulated debts, sinking back into the sea of suffering, with no day of rising ever again.

Only when one is utterly uninterested in and plain about everything in the world — retreating step by step, simple and ordinary — does the ordinary heart finally die; only then is one truly freed from the ordinary self; only then does the formation of the fruit of Dao truly begin. The magnitude of the fruit of Dao depends on how much we perform meritorious deeds and fulfill our vows; the more we perform and fulfill, the greater the fruit of Dao.

If worldly ailments are not eliminated, the fruit of Dao formed will be riddled with imperfection. Worldly ailments are like worms; the fruit of Dao is like fruit. However large the fruit, if worms are inside it has no value. However small the fruit, if there are no worms inside it retains its worth. And if the fruit is large with no worms inside, its value is certainly great. The reason the first step in cultivating the Heavenly Dao is to eliminate worldly ailments is precisely this: to cultivate a fruit of Dao that is whole and unblemished.

＊ ＊ ＊

Know that Lao Mu's grace is vast —
she has sent the Heavenly Dao to save the original spirits.
Miss this Great Salvation —
and be pressed into the shadowed mountain to await a full cosmic age.
Nine generations of descendants and seven ancestors gaze with hope —
hoping you will not squander this precious opportunity.
Having received the transmission, only truly cultivate —
truly cultivate, and truly transcend birth and death.
Never be careless and superficial —
to deceive others and deceive the master is in truth to deceive oneself.
Cleverness turns and misleads the clever —
without eliminating worldly ailments, the root of birth and death remains.
Act earnestly — do not speak in vain;
when words and actions are one, Dao forms of itself.
A narrow and small heart is not a Buddha's heart;
a scheming mind is the way of ghosts and demons.
Selfishness goes against Dao;
reckless craving and taking will surely lead to rebirth.
Humility and compassion are the root of all cultivation;
arrogance is a first-rank transgression.
Without self-reflection, delusion compounds delusion;
refusing to reform, one harms one's own being.
A calm mind and even breath invite blessings;
a restless mind and hot temper invite disaster.
Fluid and unobstructed in meeting the world — this is the conduct of Buddhas and Patriarchs;
to cling in delusion and refuse to wake is beyond remedy.
A wavering will sinks into the sea of suffering;
lacking perseverance, Dao is hard to achieve.
Truly cultivate, truly act — and immortals and Buddhas will help;
when the fruit of Dao is full and complete, it repays Lao Mu's grace.

## Commentary

The text begins with a proclamation, and it is worth pausing there. "The greatest matter between heaven and earth" — this is not hyperbole in Stanley Yu's hands. For a writer who calls himself 道友, a fellow traveler in Dao, the opening verse is not a flourish but a statement of proportion: this is what actually matters, placed against everything else that competes for attention. Countless Buddhas gather to assist; demons withdraw; ancestral chains across generations are affected. The scope is deliberately cosmic. And then, almost immediately, the second stanza turns to look at what people actually do with this cosmic opportunity — and the contrast is stark. Careless. Going through the motions. Burning incense while the heart wanders. The opening verse and the warning verse form a single pedagogical gesture: here is what is at stake, and here is how it is being squandered.

The warning verse's catalog of failures is notable for its psychological precision. It does not merely describe bad behavior — it describes recognizable behavior, behavior that passes as acceptable in ordinary life. Joining the bustle for social reasons. Prioritizing children over one's own spiritual urgency. Burning incense dutifully. These are not the sins of villains; they are the habits of decent people who have not registered the urgency of their moment. The verse is addressed not to the wicked but to the well-meaning — which makes it more unsettling.

The prose that follows establishes the essay's governing metaphor: the ailment. Stanley Yu frames spiritual shortcoming not as moral failure but as illness. To have a worldly ailment (凡病) is not shameful in the way transgression is shameful; it is something that requires diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. The physician's perspective is implied — appropriate for a text that understands cultivation as a clinical process. The underlying theology is Chan Buddhist: each person's original nature is "the primordially pure Buddha-nature within," already luminous and uncontaminated. The ailments do not constitute the self; they obscure it. This is crucial. The urgency is not guilt but hygiene: something is covering what was always clean.

From this foundation, the essay proceeds to diagnose eight specific ailments, one by one. The first — inconsistency between words and actions — is placed first for good reason. It is arguably the most dangerous not because it is the worst in itself, but because it is the one most likely to spread. When the practitioner speaks of virtue and then behaves otherwise, others see. Dao is cheapened in their eyes. The crime is not only self-corruption but the corruption of those watching. The judges of the underworld are invoked here not merely as a threat but as a recognition that there are witnesses beyond the visible.

The second ailment — narrow-heartedness and scheming — unfolds across two paragraphs that accumulate detail with the relentlessness of someone who has witnessed this pattern many times. The portrait is painfully recognizable: the person who cannot absorb a contrary word; who tracks every favor given; who deflects blame and claims credit; who smiles while hating inside. What makes this passage powerful is the cosmological frame at the end: *Small capacity yields small fortune; great capacity yields great fortune. A narrow heart is a sea of suffering; a broad heart is heaven.* This is not moralizing but metaphysics — the shape of the inner life determines the shape of the outer world one inhabits.

The third ailment — greed and selfishness — includes a passage that a careful reader will recognize as a structural allusion to the Buddhist six sense organs. Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind: each one craving its corresponding object. This is not accidental. Stanley Yu is locating the origin of craving in the architecture of perception itself — each sense organ, by its very nature, reaches out and wants. The essay does not ask whether this craving can be eliminated (the Buddhist diagnosis says it cannot be suppressed by force) but whether the practitioner can cease to be governed by it. The karmic arithmetic that follows — half a catty borrowed, eight taels repaid; one dollar taken, ten dimes returned — drives home the precision of consequence. Karma does not round up or forgive fractions.

The fourth ailment — arrogance — introduces the essay's most philosophically elegant moment. "The spirit of the fool does not diminish; the spirit of the wise does not increase." In terms of original spiritual substance, all beings are equal. This is not a sentiment but an ontological claim: the same source, the same light, in every person. To look down on another is to misunderstand the ground of one's own existence. Laozi's paradox — "Great wisdom appears as foolishness" — is not cited as a proverb but as a corrective: what you call superiority is actually the sign that you haven't arrived yet. All the great Buddhas and Patriarchs, the text says, held humility and compassion as their inner dwelling. Not as virtues they practiced but as the home they lived in.

The fifth ailment — failure to self-reflect and reform — contains the essay's most counterintuitive teaching: "The sage has many faults, the worthy few, the fool none." Read quickly, this seems like a mistake. The fool has no faults? But the meaning is precise: the fool does not perceive his faults because he never looks. The sage perceives many because he is always looking. Apparent faultlessness is the surest sign of spiritual blindness. This reverses the way most people track their own progress — mistaking the absence of perceived faults for spiritual health — and replaces it with a different measure: the more clearly one sees, the more one finds to correct, and the more one corrects, the more one's conduct naturally conforms to Dao.

The sixth ailment — restlessness and hot temper — gives the essay its most dramatic image: a whole mountain of green, burned to nothing by a single spark. Decades of accumulated merit, destroyed in one outburst of blind rage. The phrase "fire burning down the merit-grove" carries the full weight of the Buddhist teaching on anger: it is not merely harmful in the moment but retroactively destructive, unwinding what was painstakingly built. The antidote stated at the close — *When the mind is calm and the breath even, words are forgotten and thoughts stilled* — is not a technique but a condition: the natural state of a mind that is not perpetually agitated by circumstance.

The seventh ailment — stubborn delusion — accumulates its evidence through a sequence of "knowing full well... yet unable." This is perhaps the most honest passage in the essay, because it describes not ignorance but something worse: clear knowledge that does not change behavior. One knows that laboring obsessively for children and grandchildren is ultimately futile. One knows that resentment is painful. One knows that anger destroys. And yet. The Patriarch's triple escalation captures the spiritual structure of this problem: being lost is bad, being lost for a long time is worse, but *choosing to remain lost* — clinging to lostness as if it were a possession — is beyond remedy. Habit has become identity.

The final ailment — weak will and lack of perseverance — opens into the essay's most cosmologically expansive section: the doctrine of testing. The scale here is overwhelming. Fifty or sixty thousand years of accumulated karmic debt. Three thousand six hundred sages and forty-eight thousand worthies to be selected. A great reckoning of all things under heaven. Within this frame, the tests of daily life — illness, failure, slander, poverty — are revealed not as obstacles but as instruments of refinement. "Jade uncarved cannot become an instrument; iron unforged cannot become steel." The false cultivator is exposed by prosperity: given success, he becomes tyrannical and corrupt. The genuine cultivator is revealed by adversity: given poverty and illness, the Dao-heart does not waver. *Poor, let him be poor; constrained, let him be constrained.* The anaphora here is quietly magnificent — each repetition an act of acceptance, a loosening of the grip on what the world provides.

The essay's resolution — the fruit and worm image — is satisfying in the way that good metaphors always are: it makes visible what was previously only felt. A large fruit riddled with worms is worthless. A small fruit without worms retains its value. The worms are the worldly ailments. The fruit is the spiritual attainment cultivated over a lifetime. The point is not that one should be modest in one's ambitions, but that the inner condition of the fruit matters more than its size. One might cultivate great merit and great service — but if the ailments remain, eating into the fruit from within, the harvest is hollow.

The closing poem draws together all eight ailments in a compressed recapitulation — two lines each, paired couplets moving like a cadence that the reader by now can anticipate and complete. Each pair names a fault and its consequence, or a virtue and its reward. The poem functions as a mnemonic, a summary one can carry away. But it closes not on a warning but on an offer: *Truly cultivate, truly act — and immortals and Buddhas will help.* The essay, for all its diagnostic severity, ends in assistance. Lao Mu's grace, which opened the closing verse in its first couplet, returns at the last — and the fruit of Dao, once cultivated whole and unblemished, *repays* that grace. Cultivation is not merely self-improvement; it is gratitude enacted in the substance of one's being.

Stanley Yu writes as 道友 — a fellow traveler, not a teacher with authority. The essay's register is that of someone who has seen these ailments in others, recognized them in himself, and is pleading with companions who still have time. The tone is not the warmth of a holy teacher or the authority of an oracle; it is the earnest, unguarded voice of a practitioner who knows the urgency is real. The 120,000-year wait for another opportunity is not a threat but a grief. That grief, running through the warnings and the diagnoses, gives the essay its emotional foundation. Behind every "is a great ailment" is the silent addendum: *and it is so unnecessary.*
