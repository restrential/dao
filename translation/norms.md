# Translation Norms

Canonical reference for all translation conventions used in the forge pipeline. This is the single source of truth. `workflow-prompt.md` references this file; do not maintain separate copies of these norms there.

## Grammar Rules

- **再 in "X 再 Y":** In holy teachings, 再 often means "X then Y" (sequential), not "again." Read context carefully — in 言此即請勿再跪, 再 clearly means "henceforth / anymore."
- **民國 years:** Convert silently to Gregorian. Keep only Gregorian if both appear (e.g., 民國 114 → 2025).
- **勿 vs. 不:** 勿 is a prohibition ("do not / must not"); 不 is negation ("does not"). Preserve the imperative weight of 勿 in translation.

## Recurring Phrase Renderings

These phrases appear across multiple teachings and have established English forms. Apply consistently.

| Chinese | English | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 請起勿跪 | Rise — kneel no more | Gracious, ongoing release — not a momentary command. The Elder is dispensing with obeisance, not merely instructing for this moment. |
| 言此即請勿再跪 | With these words — kneel no more | 再 = "henceforth / anymore." Same releasing quality as above. |
| 好嗎 | *Is this understood?* | Italicized; soft rhetorical close of a teaching segment. |
| 是嗎 | *Is this right?* | Italicized; slightly softer than 好嗎. |
| 是吧 | *Right?* | Italicized; lightest rhetorical tag. |
| 知否 | *Do you understand?* | Italicized; classical closing formula. |
| 哈哈 | Ha ha! | The Holy Teacher's signature warmth. Never translate as mockery. |
| 哈哈退 | Ha ha — I retire. | Standard closing departure formula. |
| 哈哈止 | Ha ha — I stop here. | Mid-session pause variant. |
| 轉筆 | Changing the brush — | Planchette reposition; marks shift to new addressee or deity. |
| 辭叩 | I take my leave with a kowtow. | Formal closing bow. |
| 苦口婆心 | speaking earnestly and tenderly / with sincere, tender effort | The loving-but-exhausted mode of divine instruction; not scolding. |

## Style Rules

- **Do not name I-Kuan Tao (一貫道) explicitly** in any translation, commentary, or research note. This tradition is the wellspring of many texts translated here, but naming it is polarizing and misleading — I-Kuan Tao has evolved into its own distinct religious entity, and our work does not represent that organization. Refer instead to "this tradition," "the salvationist tradition," "the White Era tradition," or "Dao-transmission" as context requires.
- Use **Traditional Chinese** (繁體) characters when quoting or referencing Chinese text. Never Simplified.
- When citing classical sources, give the Chinese title followed by a brief English gloss: 禮記 (*Book of Rites*), 莊子 (*Zhuangzi*), 金剛經 (*Diamond Sutra*).
- For the **Final Translation**, include no inline annotations — it should read as clean, standalone text.
- **No archaic English** ("doth," "hath," "thee," "wouldst"). Modern but dignified.
- Western readers should feel the meaning without needing footnotes.
- Do not introduce ideas not present in the original.

---

## Poetic Formatting

When the source Chinese is written in verse form, the Final Translation must be formatted as a poem throughout — **including self-introduction and all transitional sections**. Do not switch to prose mid-text.

### The wu nai (吾乃) structure

Holy teachings (聖訓) typically follow this structure:

1. **Opening verse** (鎮壇詩 or similar) — couplets in classical verse; sets the teaching's theme
2. **Self-introduction** — begins 吾乃 [title] 領/奉 [Φ懿旨/敕令]; the teacher announces who they are, what decree they bear, why they have descended
3. **Main teaching body** — verse instruction, exhortation, individual addresses
4. **Closing** — blessing and/or 知否 / 好嗎; departure formula

**Rule:** When the Chinese contains a wu nai prelude (or anything structurally analogous), treat the entire text as verse. Format all sections — opening, self-introduction, main body, closing — as poem lines. Do not render conversational or narrative sections as prose paragraphs.

### Example

Rather than:
> I am the Holy Teacher, bearing Lao Mu's sacred decree. I descend into the human world, entering Dao Yin Temple — present in unseen form, humbly attending.

Prefer:
> I am the Holy Teacher, bearing Lao Mu's sacred decree —
> descending into the human world, entering Dao Yin Temple,
> present in unseen form, humbly attending.

## Commentary Guidelines

The Commentary is a sustained reflective prose reading of the teaching — not a translation note or scholarly annotation. It is pastoral: helping someone who has just read the Final Translation understand what they have encountered.

- **Prose throughout.** No bullet points, no tables, no inline citation syntax.
- **Follow the teaching's arc.** Move through the text in order so the reader feels the progression.
- **Name classical allusions where they illuminate** — in plain prose, not annotation syntax. Only where the backstory changes how the line lands.
- **Honor the teacher's persona.** Each deity has a distinct character (warmth, austerity, humor, grief). Let that shape the register.
- **Honor the tune.** The named tune (調寄) sets an emotional key; let it inform the Commentary's tone at the close.
- **Quote sparingly** from the Final Translation — one or two italicized lines per paragraph at most.
- **Length:** Coverage-based, not count-based. A short lyric may need 5–6 paragraphs; a long or densely allusive text may need 12 or more. The failure mode is insufficient coverage — rushing the arc or skipping allusions. When in doubt, err toward depth.
- **Ending:** Close on the feeling the teaching leaves behind — not a summary, but a resonance.
