- Entries 72, 73, 76–80 had mixed Simplified/Traditional characters in the source; normalized to Traditional.
- Entry **#27**'s Spanish was embedded inside the English paragraph in the source docx (separated by a double newline); correctly split on import.
- `回向` retained throughout (opencc would convert this to `迴向`; normalized back for consistency with the majority of entries).
- The English and Spanish are labeled "Preliminary Translation" in the source document.
