# Patriarch Tianran's 101 Heartfelt Admonitions

English translation of 天然師尊叮嚀心語101則.

**Status:** Preliminary translation.

---

## 1

At the final move, pioneer and consolidate Dao work hand-in-hand, without clinging to titles or a single locale. With this benevolent vow, Heaven will open the way: cultivate earnestly and you will naturally attract countless affinity-bearing believers.

## 2

Cultivate and serve the Dao through effortless action. See all sentient beings as benefactors from many lifetimes, dedicate yourself to Heaven, forget the self, and return every merit to Heaven and the Buddhas. Only then will you avoid the traps of name, profit, and power in the Dao—traps whose effects in today’s temples grieve your teacher.

## 3

Future attainment is not measured by the size of a temple or the head-count of believers, but by whether cultivators truly refine themselves, guard their vows, stay free of greed and delusion, avoid quarrel, harmonize their nature, and thus fulfill their mission.

## 4

Strive for both yourself and all beings to succeed in this very life; if salvation cannot come now, bless and pray that they find liberation in future lives. Knowing your karmic link to the Dao, sow kindness and reap gratitude, forming a current of goodness that bridges Heaven and Earth.

## 5

Disciples of the White Era must nurture vast hearts: rejoice in others’ success, praise their excellence, honor their toil. Cultivate a spirit that makes the world, the cosmos, and all beings smile with us.

## 6

The Sixth Patriarch said, “Humility within is merit; equality toward beings is virtue.” Keep gratitude and repentance alive; regard fortune and adversity alike with a gentle smile, and many troubles vanish.

## 7

At the end-time each person must transcend self: cling to no favors or grudges, loves or hates, debts or kinships. Release them as circumstances flow, and true freedom appears. If you cannot yet dwell nowhere like the sages, then at least let your mind arise yet attach to nothing.

## 8

I cannot predict the coming test of wisdom in the temples, nor can I settle your bodies and minds for you. May you grasp Heaven’s, the Buddhas’, and your teacher’s heart, and honestly cultivate while keeping your vows—just as Senior Brother Lu-tong said, “The world’s sacred tool is not to be wielded lightly—be wary! Be cautious!”

## 9

If every disciple in the White Era temples bows and prays for all beings and for the easing of calamities, the united power of good thought will reduce worldly disasters to the minimum. Heaven will surely prolong your years of Dao service.

## 10

In the End of the Dharma age, cultivators must raise vast vows, lifting their hearts to unite with the Buddhas of the ten directions. If you seek only personal liberation in this life, how can you merge into the ocean of Truth?

## 11

Cultivating the Dao surely includes guiding people, teaching the truth, opening new fields, and founding temples, yet you must not neglect concrete social action—relief for the poor, care for the elderly and orphans, environmental stewardship, aid for the intellectually disabled, even animal release and protection. All these forge wide affinities with beings of the ten directions. Do not dismiss them as merely “mundane”; without perfecting the later-heaven, how can you fulfill the earlier-heaven?

## 12

Your teacher treats every disciple impartially—palm and back of the hand are both flesh. If you are willing to serve, Heaven will turn resources your way. Some efforts grow quickly, others slowly; karma plays its part, so do not envy. Keep your resolve unchanged; I bless you deeply: hold on until the clouds part and the moon appears—bitterness will yield to sweetness.

## 13

Offer mercy, mourning, and compassionate dedication to the countless beings who perish in misfortune and disaster. During morning and evening incense-offering, do not pray solely for the expansion of Dao work; if the work grows but great compassion is missing, that is not a cultivator’s essence. Only by caring for the unfortunate with whom we have no karmic tie can we attract those with affinity.

## 14

Once vows are fulfilled and affinities settled, express your intention and refrain from needless entanglements. Seek immediate liberation, drifting free like a cloud, lest you fall into yet another karmic net to repay in future lives—that would be misfortune. I myself once penned casual couplets in play and sowed today’s rifts in the Dao circle; take heed: guard your thoughts, stir no attachments.

## 15

Though I am but a poor monk, if your minds unite in harmony, how could I ignore you? Even when conditions seem lacking, I openly aid and secretly guide, gifting each place a grand temple. Yet if your own thoughts fail to connect, how shall I face the Buddhas’ lowered brows? Truly, you put your teacher in a bind!

## 16

Cultivators should lighten worldly emotions, speak of sacred feelings, and be at ease everywhere. Never seek luxury, pomp, or splendor. I am used to poverty—one bowl begs from a thousand homes, traveling alone ten thousand miles. I cannot accept, much less train, disciples who crave wealth and show.

## 17

Cultivators must clearly separate sacred from profane, public from private; a hint of clinging brings downfall. From ancient times no true temple has traded on holiness for business. If you grasp for gain, Heaven will repay you in kind—and incompletely at that.

## 18

Do not circulate every right-wrong rumor about the temple, still less fan the flames. Cultivate merciful tolerance; treat others so, and Heaven will treat you the same.

## 19

Think always of unlocking future blessings for all beings; do not seize power or prestige, tarnish the Dao’s pure name, or wound innocent juniors. I, though virtue-lacking, have still left a human temple for my disciples to run. I ask nothing but that you protect it well and not betray Heaven’s vast grace.

## 20

Let boundless care and prayer arise in your heart for the pain and disasters of beings in all six realms. May they soon meet good conditions and gain the chance to escape the sea of suffering.

## 21

Your teacher’s whole heart still cannot speak directly to those managing the temple, because your minds do not resonate with mine. You cling too much to worldly rights-and-wrongs and to external labels, scurrying about Dao business all day yet failing to turn the light inward to innate awakening. Perhaps I lack virtue, and so cannot move you.

## 22

The Three Talents are not the monopoly of one temple. Whenever a chance arises to help people see and realize the Dao, I am willing to go anywhere to strengthen my disciples’ faith. If you fail to use such blessings well, you squander Heaven’s marvelous gift.

## 23

Heaven has given your temple many chances, yet your hearts lack sincere gratitude. You have grown weary of the long-standing karmic cases before you, pushing them away and thus losing deeper cooperation with spirits of all quarters. Even the celestial immortals poised to appear have paused or moved elsewhere. Whether the Elders can accept these words, I do not know; believing oneself free of form while still clinging to it is itself an obstacle.

## 24

I cannot forsake disciples who have left or withdrawn from the temple. From the standpoint of fellow cultivators, how can you ignore them? Keep a heart of prayer and blessing, asking Heaven’s mercy that they soon find their way back. The more genuine your intent, the more surely you will awaken them.

## 25

Do not cling to yearly fortune-readings, nor sink under adverse tides. When you make vast vows that resonate with the Buddhas’ hearts, a single thought leaps beyond three thousand worlds and the path of birth-and-death. Sentient beings of all directions are gathered by that sincere vibration—what joy!

## 26

Do not over-emphasize how many halls you have or how many believers attend, for that breeds possessiveness and competition; a slight deviation and calculation arises, and you slip from the Dao. Remember: Heaven judges merits by virtue, precepts, mindset, vows in action, and inner refinement—not by outward badges of merit.

## 27

So many have fallen unawares into the traps of Dao authority, influence, and reputation—heart-rending indeed! If cultivators cling to these appearances till the end, what more can be said? The Patriarch and Matriarch returned empty-handed, leaving only the three-realm mission and the earthly temple for you to manage; why cling to “yours” and “mine” in struggle?

## 28

Those who cultivated and returned before me are ancient sages; those who began before me are Elders; those who practice alongside me are fellow cultivators. All are precious teachers and friends from a thousand lives and deserve our respectful bows. Keep a humble heart and learn the Dao from them always.

## 29

Do not spend decades in Dao service only to grow in wealth and fame while your innate wisdom remains unmoved; that is merely worldly blessing, not true realization. Beings of the End-time must see this clearly.

## 30

Throughout cultivation, balance employing and relinquishing, acting and hiding. With the outer king’s achievements, pioneer the four quarters—this is visible Dao work. With the inner sage’s virtue, elevate the mind—this is invisible Dao work. Only by both can you truly succeed.

## 31

Dedicate your thoughts and merits to the suffering beings who are not yet saved. Pray that they soon meet good conditions to cultivate and realize the Dao; bless them so that, even if deliverance is impossible in this life, they may attain the Dao and end their pain in the next cosmic cycle.

## 32

Do not be satisfied with the happiness and comfort you presently enjoy. Be grateful for today’s cultivation setting: even in hardship it surpasses the plight of beings in hell, hungry-ghost, or animal realms. Therefore complain not, despair not, and neither grow proud nor complacent.

## 33

Throughout cultivation and service, keep spurring and elevating yourself; only thus can you enrich the light of virtue and wisdom and lighten the fetters of karmic retribution.

## 34

Read often the classics of sages and worthies. In reviewing the old and learning the new you grasp the single thread of wondrous principle and feel the painstaking heart behind their teachings.

## 35

Cultivate and serve with impartial public spirit, attributing every merit and achievement to Heavenly Mother and the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions; thus you avoid the trap of treating cultivation as personal allegiance.

## 36

When perfecting fellow Dao kin, teach according to each person’s capacity; guide all to unfold their heavenly heart and nature, making reason-based cultivation the vital focus.

## 37

Tests will always arrive; the great final wisdom exam of the White Era is close at hand. Be mentally prepared—“settled and calm to meet wind and rain.” In this Dao game, my disciples must undergo polishing and trial to become true talents.

## 38

Strengthen the inner fortitude of your Dao kin; hold fast to the root of cultivation and nurture that spark of light within human nature. Even if this life yields no enlightenment, preserving unclouded good thoughts enables transcendence in future lives through non-regression.

## 39

Cultivate a mind that sees Principle-Heaven and Pure Land everywhere; then the wind of the bodhi path will spread across the human world—what worries could your teacher still have? May you seize every living moment to open this opportunity.

## 40

Follow the pioneering spirit of your predecessors to extend the life of wisdom. Unite on principle and Dao, not on personalities; each exert your utmost to steady the Dao situation.

## 41

Follow the classic teachings: see the worthy and aspire to equal them, revere discipline, advance by admiring virtue. Never turn immortals, Buddhas, or any individual into an idol of worship.

## 42

Root yourselves in virtue and honor the precepts; exhort and uplift one another, cultivating and serving together to manifest the spirit of the great Maitreya family.

## 43

Let not greed or anger spark resentful outrage. Under the great rule of no-greed, no-delusion, and sincere practice, obey the elders’ last charge and spread the selfless Dao to relieve the world. Right and wrong are judged by Heaven; refrain from argument lest you split the temple.

## 44

All rivers converge into the sea and return to the one source. If you cultivate and serve in truth, Heaven will never fail you even when people do. Amid the ever-shifting Dao arena ahead, hold fast to your mission and duty.

## 45

Transmitting masters must live and cultivate uprightly, openly, and honorably; only thus will their heavenly mandate remain unsullied.

## 46

Promoting transmitting masters, lecturers, and the Three Talents demands careful deliberation and orderly procedure; haste or chaos may trade great gains for trivial losses.

## 47

There are already too many White-Era temples—what does that signify? When your teacher and Matriarch were alive, did we have grand halls? How did we serve the Dao then? Disciples, ponder this well!

## 48

Only the resolve of freshly awakened newcomers can be called truly pure and simple; veteran followers must still ground themselves and leap free of the tangle of right and wrong.

## 49

The imminent great exam of the White Era is Heaven’s line of selection and elimination. World affairs, Dao affairs, human affairs—all are shifting, and even I cannot balance them.

## 50

Each person’s rise or fall is tied to the nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of descendants; how could a cultivator not tread with utmost care?

## 51

If you never read the writings of sages, you cannot grasp their spirit; then, when crisis comes, how will you calmly face the choices of life-and-death or rise-and-fall?

## 52

Your teacher’s heart is weary—who can sense it, who can share it? I hope you advance to serve and retreat to cultivate. As I have said: refine the Dao and the mind, serve the Dao with full devotion, perfect yourself and save others—always start well and finish well.

## 53

Until your realization is complete, never harbor greedy fantasies or certify your own merit; one wrong thought and you fall into the demon’s snare.

## 54

Be extremely strict with yourself yet generous with others; keep a forgiving heart and always leave a broad path of return for Dao kin who repent.

## 55

If you seek liberation only for this life, our bond ends here; but if you raise vast bodhi compassion, weaving wide affinities to aid beings, then in the next cosmic era we will meet again, companions in guiding this saha world through lifetime after lifetime. That is the cultivator’s undying, heroic vow.

## 56

Cherish every minute and every instant of thought, guarding this spark of living radiance.

## 57

The celestial timing is perilous; beings are amid great catastrophe. How can you not seize every moment to cultivate and serve? Where is the leisure to judge others? How much time do you have to waste?

## 58

Disciples! Heaven no longer allows delay; strive with vigor and do not betray the grace of the Buddhas who aid and await you.

## 59

Without many trials and human setbacks on the path, how could you build deep virtue and elevate the mind? Understand this, and in adversity breed no resentment or vexation that would sink you deeper.

## 60

Treasure every test that can perfect you; respect each being’s view and critique, learning to accept counsel and even harsh reproach with a joyful, harmonious heart. I shall bless you; in this way you build not only a complete character but also a peaceful, harmonious temple.

## 61

Pray for all who suffer in this world, wishing that they too may achieve. If you, my disciples, prove your mettle, your teacher can worry less and transfer this love and care to other beings, hastening their good affinities.

## 62

Treasure every karmic condition at all times, yet cling to none; then no circumstance will obstruct your path of cultivation.

## 63

Respect immortals and Buddhas, but do not cling to their outward forms.

## 64

Lay the self aside, cut needless troubles, and do not let momentary emotional ties wreck everything in an instant.

## 65

Keep this mind clear without attachment; only thus will future lives no longer stray in delusion.

## 66

Always preserve sincere faith in cultivation, regardless of favorable or adverse conditions inside or out.

## 67

Learn the Matriarch’s art of remaining hidden and humble.

## 68

The Three Pure Ones’ precepts must be kept; separate public from private and never take advantage of sentient beings.

## 69

Do not dwell only on others’ rights and wrongs; look for their good qualities and discover the beauty and simplicity of human nature—this is prajñā wisdom.

## 70

When perfecting people of ability, attend to their real virtue: one hero may blossom amid applause, yet another of equal worth can wither in neglect.

## 71

When raising people into new roles, be sure their title matches their true substance; otherwise Heaven’s timing and human affairs will be delayed.

## 72

A cultivator must continually release every snag—inside and outside the body, within and beyond the mind—so that life becomes free and easy.

## 73

Learn to be a clear stream in a muddy world, a candle of light in the storm-dark night.

## 74

Heaven cherishes most the honest, down-to-earth people who cultivate faithfully within their proper bounds.

## 75

Cultivators must master the Buddhist rules and rites; they are indispensable lessons on the path.

## 76

When confronted with grave, puzzling problems, bow often to Heavenly Mother; utmost sincerity brings its own marvel. The first selfless thought that appears is Heaven’s guidance. This is exactly how I handled difficulties in former days.

## 77

Respect the karmic ties of every temple and every being. Cultivate and serve with all your heart; do not squander this once-in-sixty-thousand-years chance.

## 78

The work you safeguard does not belong to anyone—-it is Heavenly Mother’s. Human leadership is only the surface of converging karma, so harbor no notion of cultivating “for” someone. Broaden your hearts, raise your vision of service, form wide affinities as people see and realize the Dao, and, while turning Heaven and Earth to open new temples so all may succeed, dedicate even the smallest result back in gratitude to Heavenly Mother.

## 79

At this very moment countless beings suffer in cyclic existence, and many cultivators sink under trials—can you feel how heavy your teacher’s heart is? Right now, please pray and dedicate merit for those millions.

## 80

Strive to understand people’s situations and help them clear doubts and find release. None of us are flawless sages—who is free of mental or physical faults? Assist with a forgiving heart, freeing them from remorse and pain, and wait for their return and renewal.

## 81

All Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and beings throughout the three realms and ten directions rejoice that, in this Maitreya cycle, universal salvation is at hand. They pour their compassionate vows into helping close the three spheres, yet the leadership of this vast karmic project must be carried out on Earth. Disciples, you White-Era cultivators must seize this splendid time: harbor no envy or grasping, practice sincerely, and you will not betray the aid of Heaven and humankind.

## 82

Now, at the end-time, all true and false, good and evil, are surfacing. This is not Heaven handing out an exam; it is cultivators’ mind-sets having drifted—because they cannot see through Dao-name, Dao-power, Dao-status, and because of human squabbles. “Demons arise from the mind, tests are invited by oneself.” Guard your subtlest thoughts!

## 83

Your teacher, lacking ability and virtue, could not inspire you to carry the path through to the end, so the temple has splintered into competing fiefdoms. I regret not staying longer to guide you. Many have run the peerless temple like a child’s game, shaming Heavenly Mother’s grace and the Patriarchs’ trust.

## 84

Earth-side cultivators cling so tightly to merit and titles that every new project draws endless interference and heavy karma. The ghosts and debtors of the unseen are easier to guide: already suffering, they crave nothing more than to kneel at a Dharma assembly, hear the Buddha-rain, receive a ray of light, and instantly release greed, anger, delusion, pride—harboring no thoughts of merit or rank. Grateful and repentant, they await the saints’ orders, assist Dao work everywhere, and transcend suffering on the spot. Such is the special power of descending to the netherworld.

## 85

In the underworld there are also workers and lecturers who uphold the Heavenly Dao, assisting Kṣitigarbha Ancient Buddha in caring for souls awaiting release. Living in hell, they know its pain and feel Heaven’s grace more keenly, free from worldly quarrels; Heavenly Mother often praises them. Disciples, cultivate all the harder so your teacher and Matriarch need not worry.

## 86

Today the temples look impressive, disciples of the Living Buddha fill the world; outwardly one should rejoice, yet I feel ashamed. I am but a crazy monk holding the empty title of Three-Realm Guide. All glory belongs to Heavenly Mother’s grace and the Patriarch’s vast kindness, and Dao work relies on the silent protection of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas carrying out Heavenly Mother’s command. Were it not for their nameless virtue, how could we spread Dao across the seas or forge wide affinities? May you ever revere the Buddhas’ kindness.

## 87

Grand halls and solemn shrines are surely useful, but if workers of the Dao keep comparing outer appearances they stray from the Way’s true aim. Your teacher once had not even one temple, roaming the world with empty sleeves yet moving unimpeded. In these times of limited heavenly allowance, it would be better to redirect the sincere donations of beings to relieve worldly suffering—supporting environmental protection and medical aid—this too is the wholesome path for White-Era cultivators.

## 88

The Earth is riddled with wounds; if we do not strive to repair and restore it, this beautiful planet will wither and die in our hands. Saints and immortals of all realms worry for you. Disciples, beyond moral and spiritual ecology, you must actively participate in concrete environmental preservation.

## 89

The progress of Dao work depends half on human effort, half on Heaven; when sincerity moves Heaven and conditions ripen, results flow naturally. Prosperity in Dao work is joyous, yet never overlook relief for the world’s suffering. Today Somalia’s chaos, Bosnia’s strife, Cambodia’s unrest, the Kurdish people’s hardship—they are Heavenly Mother’s children, your kin over many lives. Pray and dedicate merit for them, and, if possible, promptly engage in tangible aid.

## 90

Cultivate earnestly and safeguard the Dao wheel and its wisdom-life. Your teacher leaves you nothing but the hope that you will kindly treat the countless brothers and sisters who truly refine themselves—let them emerge, succeed, and return to Principle-Heaven. The ancients said, “To realize unsurpassed Buddhahood, first become cattle and horses for beings.” We cultivators should let beings stand on our shoulders to attain the Way. I am willing, like the Buddhas, to pave the road with flesh and blood so that beings may walk securely and become Buddhas.

## 91

Strictly speaking, all the toil a cultivator expends along the path scarcely counts as “merit.” Whatever small merit there is must repay karmic debts, requite ancestors, ensure safety, fund the return to Heaven—and be offset by one’s daily faults. Disciples, can you still boast of your “great merits”?

## 92

Perhaps you did not grasp my earlier plea to learn the Matriarch’s art of “concealment.” Emulate her: hide your name in the world, your appearance across the three spheres, your merit within Heaven-oriented resolve. My wild name and visage are public, yet who knows the Matriarch’s quiet virtue? She surpasses me. In these last days, dim your radiance, store your merit, let no fame eclipse Heavenly Mother’s grace in mortal hearts.

## 93

Soon “thirty-six false archers” and “seventy-two fake Maitreya” illusions will appear—projections of the inner mind, not external phenomena. Today’s splintered temples and power struggles arise from selfish hearts; the Heavenly Marshal steps back, demonic forces move in. Unaware, one falls deeper into error. Disciples, work hard at precepts, concentration, and wisdom; with genuine insight shatter endless ignorance, walk the Way in open light, and you will resist all lures.

## 94

A cultivator must be proper, sincere, solid. Even the junior who cleans toilets or towels may one day earn Heaven’s rank. If you crave display and cling to merit, posing as a gentleman yet lacking the gentle magnanimity that welcomes beings, you miss Heaven’s heart and your attainments stay small; one lifetime’s realization does not guarantee non-regression forever. Therefore nurture purity, honesty, truth, bear toil without complaint, and always treat the un-saved kindly.

## 95

The Three-Talent officer must stay pure and bright, move Heaven and Earth by Heaven’s own heart, ever holding the thought of action-through-non-action and realization-through-non-self. Thus he can benefit limitless beings—no less than a pioneering Elder. But if he basks too long in human praise, forgetting Heaven-Buddha imprimatur, he soon traps himself, fails to grasp subtlety, and cannot enter the Buddhas’ vast, unhindered communion. If vows remain unfinished, how will he report at South-Flower Palace?

## 96

Escaping the worldly arena of fame and profit is hard enough—do not fall into another vortex by turning administrative structures into ends in themselves. Such frameworks are expedient; appoint capable people and comply with laws, and Elders need not cling to positions. Remember: Heaven’s universal salvation still fishes for the worthy in secret; a gentleman’s virtue shines quietly day by day. Do not chase media applause while losing the ancient sages’ sense of bearing heavy trust amid peril. What your teacher and Matriarch left you is the Dao wheel, not a church.

## 97

Cultivators in the Dharma’s twilight must guard the mind; the slightest drift brings self-ruin. Karmic creditors and the asura realm have now agreed: they will no longer seize lives or demand merit; they wait for your mind to deviate, then your own sacred spirit betrays, dragging nine generations up and seven down, and ripping apart Dao work. Look at the chaos in some temples—will you not quickly warn, examine, awaken yourselves?

## 98

Never grab credit or fruits in the temple, never judge other lineages’ mandates as true or false, never force believers to be “re-pointed,” even under the same Elder claim others’ pointing invalid. Did Heavenly Mother’s and the Patriarchs’ supreme One-Finger turn to gold only in your hand and to iron in others’? Absurd! One greedy thought, one slanderous word, wounds the labors of generations of Patriarchs and breaks the grave precept against shedding the Buddha’s blood and splitting the sangha. Provided we defy neither Heaven nor Patriarchs nor proclaim ourselves supreme, each lineage’s mandate is accountable to Heaven. The golden thread rests on authentic cultivation. Disciples, respect every source, help one another, and protect harmony in the three-realm temple.

## 99

I have just returned from China’s northeast where asura cruelties are fierce. Nearly a hundred disciples there bore the catastrophe, clinging to vows unto death, crying for the teacher’s compassion. I knew they had to realize righteousness under unbending threat—could not save them—my grief is immense! For decades countless disciples there, in a sea of blood, guard wisdom-life, cultivating truly, coveting nothing; you in free lands cannot compare. If you still squander Heaven’s grace in petty quarrels, the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first hells await your fall!

## 100

The mainland is not yet ready for large-scale Dao work; if karma allows, you may sow seeds, but guard your safety—let no carelessness harm you. Do not contact the old Elders there, lest you imperil them; this is Maitreya Patriarch’s way to protect the Dao seed. The time of judgment has come. Disciples! Cultivators must commit their very lives to Heaven, applying full sincerity and effort—no more muddling along!

## 101

Back then your teacher, too, was merely a transmitting master bearing the extra load of lineage. From the moment the Matriarch and I received Heaven’s mandate in the Eight-Trigram Furnace, we served only seventeen years before returning. Every achievement was Heaven’s gift—how dare we claim credit! Today many transmitting masters have served longer than I; ask yourselves whether virtue, true skill, and genuine kindness match your rank. After the Elders passed, instead of repaying grace and guarding the temple, you founded factions, pulled followers, attacked each other, leaving millions perplexed. How does this honor Heavenly Mother and the Buddhas? Lacking virtue, I might as well resign as Three-Realm Teacher! Disciples, make me proud: all worldly things are mere labels—do not let labels upend your true Buddha-nature. Do you grasp your teacher’s pain?
