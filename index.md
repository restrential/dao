# Dao

Teaching others about the sacred Dao message.

## Context
- Phillip moved to California ~2 years ago (after COVID) to learn from temple seniors
- Manages IT for a temple
- Runs a small nonprofit spiritual organization with members in California, New York, Taiwan, and Vermont
- Refers to himself humbly as `hx` (後學) in first-person within Dao contexts

## Goals
- Share the wisdom and philosophy of Dao accessibly
- Make ancient teachings relevant to modern audiences
- Support the spiritual growth of those in the Dao family
- Help carry forward Dao into the next generation

## Ongoing Needs
- **Song library streaming** — nonprofit has a large library of songs; want to help tech-illiterate members stream them (Synology music server being considered)
- **Knowledge base** — need both an IT knowledge base and a translation knowledge base; Notion under consideration (current stack: Airtable, Box, Google Workspace, Azure VM, Zapier, Zoom, Mattermost)
- **Mattermost** — private channel to monitor rare negative press and maintain awareness
- **Meeting recordings** — large volume in Chinese; interest in tooling to analyze speaker dynamics (e.g., interruption counting)
