- Use Traditional Chinese as the source language
- Favor simplicity and clarity in the English output

### Practice & Conduct

### Dates
- **民國 years:** Convert silently to Gregorian. If both 民國 and Gregorian year appear together, keep only the Gregorian year (e.g., 民國 114 → 2025).

## Grammar & Syntax Notes
- **再 in "X 再 Y":** In holy teachings, 再 often means "X then Y" (sequential) rather than "again." Translate according to context.
