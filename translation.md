# Dao — Translation

Translating nuanced spiritual Chinese text into culturally streamlined and intuitive modern English.

## Goals
- Preserve the depth and nuance of the original Chinese
- Avoid overly literal or academic phrasing
- Make the meaning accessible and natural to modern English readers without losing cultural and spiritual fidelity

## Guiding Principles
- Prioritize felt meaning over word-for-word accuracy
- Use Traditional Chinese as the source language
- Favor simplicity and clarity in the English output

## Terminology Conventions

### Divine / Cosmological
| Chinese | Translation |
|---|---|
| Φ (or 申 used as self-introduction in holy teachings) | Lao Mu / Heavenly Mother / God — whichever fits context best; pinyin "Mu3" |
| 道 | Dao (not "the Tao"; drop the article "the" before Dao) |
| 白陽時期 | the White Era |

### Titles & Roles
| Chinese | Translation |
|---|---|
| 濟公活佛 | (the) Holy Teacher |
| 師尊 | Patriarch |
| 師母 | Matriarch |
| 老前人 | Grand Elder |
| 前人 | Elder |
| 點傳師 | transmitting master(s) (context-dependent) |
| 佛堂 | temple |

### Dates
- **民國 years:** Convert silently to Gregorian. If both 民國 and Gregorian year appear together, keep only the Gregorian year (e.g., 民國 114 → 2025).

## Grammar & Syntax Notes
- **再 in "X 再 Y":** In holy teachings, 再 often means "X then Y" (sequential) rather than "again." Translate according to context.
